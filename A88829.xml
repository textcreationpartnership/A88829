            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O glorifie God, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit man, both by doing good, and preventing and removing evil, ſhould be the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as its the duty, of every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in his ſtation. Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I have undertaken this exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Mr. <hi>Hobbs:</hi> I was indeed at the firſt unwilling, though ſollicited, to do any ſuch thing; becauſe upon the peruſal of the Political part of his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> I conceived, that as little good was to be expected, ſo little harm was to be feared from that book. Yet after that I underſtood by divers learned and judicious friends, that it
<pb facs="tcp:170310:3"/>took much with many Gentlemen and young Students in the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and that it was judged to be a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional piece, I wondered; for though I knew the diſtemper of the times to be great, yet by this I found it to be far greater then I formerly ſuſpected. And upon which conſiderations I judged it profitable and convenient, if not neceſſary, to ſay ſomething to the Gentleman; and did ſo. After that I had communicated my pains unto divers worthy and learned friends, they preſſed me to give way to the Printing of them, which I did, if they after ſerious peruſal ſhould think them worthy the Preſs. They were at length approved, and again by ſome deſired to be publick; yet by others thought too brief, and I was deſired to enlarge. But this I refuſed to do,
<pb facs="tcp:170310:3"/>both becauſe there is very little, if any thing material at all in Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Politicks, omitted by me and not examined; and alſo becauſe I had formerly fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed a Treatiſe of Civil and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Government, which if it had not been loſt by ſome negligence, after an <hi>Imprimatur</hi> was put upon it, might have prevented and made void the Political part of Mr. <hi>Hobbs:</hi> and though one Copy be loſt, yet there is another, which may become publick hereafter. When thou haſt read this brief Examination, thou maiſt, if ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and impartial, eaſily judge, whether there be any thing in Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> which is either excellent or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary: and whether there be not many things inconſiſtent, not only with the ſacred Scriptures, but with
<pb facs="tcp:170310:4"/>the rules of right reaſon. But not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to prepoſſeſs thee, I commit thee to God, and remain,</p>

               <hi>CAP. I.</hi> Of Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his Leviathan, concerning the Cauſes, Generation, and Definition of a Common-wealth.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ivil Government derives its Being from Heaven: for it is a part of Gods Government over mankind, wherein he uſeth the Miniſtery of Angels, and the ſervice of men: yet ſo, as that he reſerves the ſupreme and univerſal Power in his own hands, with a liberty to depoſe the Rulers of the World at will and pleaſure, and transfer the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of one Nation to another; to lay the foundation of great Empires, and again to deſtroy them for their iniquity. To think that the ſole or principal Cauſe of the conſtitution of a civil State is the conſent of men, or that it aims at no further end then peace and plenty, is too mean a conceit of ſo noble an effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And in this particular I cannot excuſe Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> who in the modelling both of a Civil, and alſo of an Eccleſiaſtical Common-wealth, proceeds
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170310:6"/>upon principles not only weak, but alſo falſe and dangerous. And for this reaſon I undertake him. This ſhould have been done by ſome wel-skill'd in Political Learning, and not by me who do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, it as being a Divine, and one of the meaneſt amongſt many. And my intention is not to inform my Betters, who know the vanity and abſurdity of his diſcourſe, but to undeceive the ignorant Reader, who may too eaſily be ſurprized.</p>
            <list>
               <item>The firſt Chapter of the ſecond Part, which is the ſeventeenth of his Book, doth inform us, Firſt, <hi>That the end of civil Government, is Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Secondly, <hi>This Security cannot be had in the State of Nature, becauſe it is the ſtate of War; nor by a weak, nor a great multitude, except united by one perpetual judgement.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Thirdly, <hi>A great multitude are thus united, when they conferr all their power and ſtrength upon one man or aſſembly of men, that may reduce all their wils by plurality of voices to one will,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>From whence ariſeth a Common-wealth.</hi>

               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Againſt all this, ſome thing may be excepted. For Firſt, That the State of Nature is the State of War, may be doubted, if not denied; For man is a rational creature, and if he act according to his nature, he muſt act rationally: and though he may ſeek to preſerve himſelf, and that ſometimes with the dammage or deſtruction of another, yet he cannot, may not do this unjuſtly, but according to the Laws of Nature; which are two:

            </p>
            <p>Theſe tend directly unto Peace, not unto War, which is unnatural; and they may be kept by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of men not united in a civil State, or under a form of Government. And this is evident from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and profane Hiſtories. For Families and Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, which had no dependance one upon another, and alſo States both by confederation, and without any ſuch thing, have lived peaceably together. When the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The Gentiles which have not the Law, by nature do the things conta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> in the Law,</hi> he doth not mean by [Nature] a Common-wealth, or form of Government civil. Its true, the Apoſtle brings in a Bill of Indictment againſt all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and accuſeth them, <hi>That their feet are ſwift to ſhed blood: Deſtruction and calamity or miſery are in their ways; And the way of peace they have not known,</hi> Rom. 3.15, 16, 17. Yet he underſtands this not of Nature, but the corruption of Nature: and the parties here accuſed, are not men only as in the ſtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but alſo under a Government, and that not only Civil but Eccleſiaſtical too: For ſuch the Jews here charged, were. So that all that can be either by him evidently proved, or by others granted, is, That if by Nature, he mean corruption of Nature, and the ſame not only original and native, but alſo acquired by perpetual acts, ſo far as to quench the light of Nature, and ſuppreſs the vigour of thoſe Principles which God left as reliques of his image, then his Poſition may be true, That the ſtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170310:7"/>is the ſtate of War. Secondly, That by a well-conſtituted civil Government, to which Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines man, the Laws of Nature and Peace may be more eaſily and better obſerved.</p>
            <p>But I haſten to his Definition of a Common-wealth, and it is thus defined by Mr. <hi>Hobbs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Common-wealth is a Perſon, of whoſe acts a great multitude by mutual Covenant one with another have made themſelves every one the Author, to the end he may uſe the ſtrength and means of them all, as he ſhall think expedient for their peace and common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</hi>

In a word, it agrees to any unlawful multitude, united to do miſchief; For here is no mention of reaſon, or juſtice, or law; <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and other Authors uſe to qualifie their Definition of a State, with ſome ſuch term; For they make it <gap reason="foreign">

               <item>4. A Common-wealth may be defined in another manner, thus; It is a community of men orderly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to a ſupreme power civil, that they may live peaceably in all godlineſs and honeſty.</item>

                  <item>1. The community, as the Matter and Subject.</item>
                  <item>2. The ſupreme Power civil informing this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</item>

            <p n="1">1. The community is the Matter, of which ſome things may be obſerved; as

                  <item>1. That the name in Greek is [<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>] in Latine <hi>[Civitas]</hi> which is not as the Author ſaith, a Common-wealth in proper ſenſe: for that in Greek is [<gap reason="foreign">

                  </item>
                  <item>2. That it is a multitude of reaſonable Men, not a Leviathan, which is an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational Brute. The number of this multitude may be greater or leſs, and not certainly determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. For <hi>Raguſa</hi> a little City, as well as the vaſt Roman Empire, may be a community to make a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect State.</item>
                  <item>3. This community muſt be aſſociated and united not only in vicinity of place, which is convenient, but alſo in ſome ſtricter bond, before they can be capable of a ſupreme Power.</item>
                  <item>4. The Members of this Society are by nature free, and by God, to whom they are ſubject, left at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170310:8"/>to chooſe what Governours or form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment they pleaſe; yet ſo that they muſt deſire and endeavour the beſt, and ſuch as ſhall be moſt conducing to Peace and Righteouſneſs.</item>
                  <item>5. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it fals out, and is ſo ordered by Providence, that a People who have continued for a certain time under a form of Government, return unto their firſt liberty; yet even then, when God doth offer them an opportunity to eſtabliſh the beſt form and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, that they are fearfully divided. Some are for the former Government, others idolize ſome new Idea framed in their own brains.</item>
               </list>
Others in the mean time get the ſword into their hands, and once poſſeſſed of Power, are unwilling to part with it. Yet theſe ſometimes are diſpoſſeſſed again; in the mean time the People like ſo many waves of the Sea, are toſſed this way and that way, by contrary winds, like as in <hi>Daniels</hi> viſion, when he ſaw the four winds ſtrive upon the great Sea, out of which aroſe the great Empires of the world, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.2, 3, &amp;c. And all this comes to paſs through the juſt Judgement of God, and the wilful folly of men, who are enemies to their own Peace. Laſtly, In theſe many alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Governours and forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Community abides the ſame, except it be cut off by the ſword, as the <hi>Amalakites</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites</hi> were, or deſtroyed by ſome extraordinary Judgement, as <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> with fire and brimſtone from heaven.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part of the Definition is [the Supreme Power] And here we muſt conſider,
<list>
                  <item>1. The Nature of Power in general.</item>
                  <item>2. The Nature of ſupreme Power civil.</item>

                  <item>3. The Original of it.</item>
                  <item>4. The Subject wherein its fixed.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Power, in Latine <hi>[Poteſtas]</hi> in Greek [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] is <hi>[Jus imperandi]</hi> a quality inherent in a Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our as ſuch, whereby he can effectually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or bind any perſon ſubject, as ſubject. <hi>Imperium</hi> or Command is properly an act of a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Will, whereby the perſon ſubject is bound to obedience or puniſhment: It preſuppoſeth the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and practical Judgement, whereby it is directed: and is to no purpoſe without an executive power and coactive force, ſufficient to protect the Subject obeying, and puniſh him, if he prove diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient; And becauſe the Judgement may be errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the command unjuſt, therefore there can be no <hi>Jus imperandi,</hi> without Divine wiſdom to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Underſtanding, and Juſtice to regulate the Will, which is to direct the coactive force. And though Superiours may in many things abuſe their Superiority, yet they do not ceaſe to be Superiours, though as abuſing their power, they are not Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours; becauſe <hi>Nulla datur Poteſtas ad malum;</hi> none can have power to bind contrary to Divine Wiſdom and Juſtice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Supreme Power civil, which is in Latine called <hi>[Majeſtas]</hi> which is <hi>[maxima Poteſtas in Civitate]</hi> may be defined out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. to be a Sword committed by God, unto higher Powers, for to puniſh the bad, and protect the good. For 1. In all Government civil there muſt be a ſword which is an outward coactive ſtrength and force, and the ſame ſufficient for the end it was ordained and given by God.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170310:9"/>How otherwiſe can there poſſibly be any ſufficient protection or puniſhment within the precincts of the community and territory. And here two things are to be obſerved.
<list>
                  <item>1. That one and the ſame Sword muſt protect from enemies without, and unjuſt Subjects within. For the Sword of War and Juſtice are but one Sword.</item>
                  <item>2. That there is a plain difference between Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Power, between the Sword and the Keyes.</item>
               </list>
For what is bound by the civil Power on Earth, is bound and made good on earth by an earthly Sword: But what is bound on earth by the Spiritual Power is bound in heaven, and made good, and executed by Jeſus Chriſt, and that by a Spiritual force upon a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Promiſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly this Sword muſt protect the good, and puniſh the bad; which implies there muſt be wiſe and juſt Laws. 2. There muſt be juſt judgement ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe Laws. For otherwiſe there can be no true and certain knowledge of good and bad, for to put a difference between them, that the one may be puniſhed for violation, the other protected for the obſervation of the Laws. And here again we muſt note,
<list>
                  <item>1. That there is a threefold Power civil, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three degrees of that Power. The firſt is Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlative. The ſecond Judicial. The third Executive. For Legiſlation, Judgement, and Execution by the Sword, are the three eſſential acts of ſupreme Power civil in the adminiſtration of a State.</item>
                  <item>2. That there is no Power to puniſh the good and protect the bad. For the Sword muſt execute according to Judgement, and that muſt paſs according to Laws: and both Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Laws muſt be regulated by Divine Wiſdom and Juſtice.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:170310:9"/>
            <p>Thirdly, This Sword muſt be in the hands and poſſeſſion of higher or ſupereminent Governors. For a Title without the poſſeſſion of a Sword can neither puniſh nor protect: Therefore in all States of the world, they who have poſſeſſion of the Sword do rule, let the Title be what it will, neither can it be otherwiſe. And no Prince can rule, when God hath taken away his Sword.</p>
            <p>It hath been declared in ſome meaſure:
<list>
                  <item>1. What Power in General.</item>
                  <item>2. What Power civil in Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular is. The third thing concerning this ſupremacy of Power to be examined, is the original of it.</item>
               </list>
And the ſame Text of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, that it is of God; therefore in the Definition I ſaid, That the Sword was committed by God to higher Powers, who become ſuch by this Commiſſion, when God gives them poſſeſſion of the Sword. So that the Original of this Power is from God, both in reſpect of the Power, and the perſons poſſeſſed of Power. For it is he that gives Underſtanding, Will and Power ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for to govern: he gives Wiſdom and Juſtice: he commands all Societies that have opportunity to ſet up a wiſe and juſt Government for Peace and Godlineſs. In reſpect of the perſons, he deſigns them either in an ordinary or extraordinary way; he inclines the hearts of the people to ſubmit and obey: he prevents ſeditions, rebellions, treaſons, and ſuch like acts as tend to confuſion and the ruin of Common-wealths, according to that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Thou haſt delivered me from the ſtrivings of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> Pſal. 18.43. <hi>And it is God that ſubdueth the people under me,</hi> Pſal. 47. In this deſignation, God ſometimes uſeth the conſent, tacit or expreſs,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170310:10"/>ſometimes the force and conſent of Man.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Subject of this Power is either ſtanding, or movable. The ſtanding Subject by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the community, in whom vertually it reſides, and is exerciſed by a general repreſentative upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary occaſions, or at certain determinate times. And this is the beſt way to preſerve liberty, if theſe general Aſſemblies be well ordered, and fit perſons rightly qualified be choſen. For its dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to truſt either one man, or a number of men with too much power, &amp; the conſtant exerciſe of the ſame. This ſupreme power reſerved to the whole communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be exerciſed as neceſſity or occaſion ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, might be called <hi>[Realis Majeſtas]</hi> yet every Community is neither ſo wiſe nor ſo happy. For in moſt States we find only a perſonal Majeſty, or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power, and the ſame ſometimes Deſpotical, and too abſolute; yet in other Common-wealths, the ſupreme Governours are limited, and only truſted with the exerciſe of the power according to certain Rules and fundamental Laws.</p>
            <p>Of this Majeſty or ſupreme Power, civil, ſome Writers have obſerved, that it muſt be not only ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, but alſo perpetual and above Laws; <hi>[ſoluta Logibus]</hi> That it muſt be ſupreme, and above all ſubordinate power within, and independent upon all other ſoveraigns without its neceſſary. It muſt be alſo perpetual and fixed, that it may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the extraordinary and temporary pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers truſted in the hands of one or more upon extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary occaſions. How far it is abſolute or above the Laws, I ſhall examine hereafter.</p>
            <p>After the ſupreme Power civil is determined and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170310:10"/>ſixed in a certain Subject, Subjection to it follows, which is the third thing in the Definition. <hi>Regimen eſt ordo Imperii &amp; ſubjectionis.</hi> For in all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſome muſt be above and have power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; ſome muſt be below, and be bound to obey. And in a civil State there muſt be one univerſal ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, to which all others in the Community muſt ſubject themſelves. This Subjection muſt be rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, free, and orderly, or elſe the State cannot continue long, nor be well adminiſtred. And wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom muſt determine not only the general order of ſuperiour and inferiour, but alſo in particular the Community muſt be divided into parts with a co-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of equals, and ſubordination of the une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals, and of every ſeveral part unto the whole, that ſo every one may know his place and rank, that he may keep it. Therefore the Apoſtle commands eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not barely to be ſubject any ways but in a certain order; for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity muſt be like an Army put in array, that ſo the ſupreme Power may the better animate and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it: upon which followeth a more regular moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this great body both in the whole and every part, tending the more directly to Peace, Godlineſs and Honeſty.</p>
            <p>For there is a twofold end of regular civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; The firſt is Peace; The ſecond is God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Honeſty, to which Peace is ſubordinate. For the Apoſtle exhorts us <hi>to pray for Kings, and all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all Godlineſs and Honeſty:</hi> 1 Tim. 2.1. Government is for Peace, Peace for Godlineſs, and the performance of our duty towards God, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170310:11"/>That we may live ſoberly and juſtly towards men. When God doth bleſs a people with a ſetled Government and an happy peace, (for theſe are Gods bleſſings) neither Prince nor people muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their God, or live in Luxury, and deal unjuſtly one with another. For theſe things offend him, provoke him to anger, and pull down his Judgements upon them. He expects Piety and Honeſty from every one, even from the higheſt to the loweſt. And theſe earthly States are erected, and ſubordinated to an higher end then peace and plenty here on earth: they ſhould be ſo ordered as to prepare men for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: otherwiſe <hi>Regna</hi> are but <hi>latrocinia,</hi> a den of thieves, and a combination of devils. Thus much I thought good to deliver concerning the Nature of a Common-wealth civil. The Diſtribution fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hobbs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Common-wealth is either by inſtitution or acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>G. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is not the diſtribution of a Common-wealth either into the integral parts, which are two,
<list>
                  <item>1. The ſoveraign</item>
                  <item>2. The ſubject: not into the kinds: for thoſe are uſually taken from the ſeveral manners of diſpoſing the ſupreme power in one or more to make it Monarchical or Polycratical; but its a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the manner of acquiring ſupreme power. And the ordinary way, or rather means whereby it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170310:11"/>is acquired, is either by force or conſent.</item>
               </list>
Yet this diſtinction is imperfect: for there be other means beſides theſe: neither when ſupreme Power is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained either by force or conſent, is a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth framed. The Power is alwayes derived from God, as before: and he takes it from one, and gives to another, either in an extraordinary or an ordinary way of Providence: as by giving a finall victory, or inclining mens hearts, and that upon ſeveral reaſons to ſubmit, and ſometimes ſo, that if they had liberty and power, they would not conſent at all. And though men may be unjuſt in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring and ſeeking, yet he is juſt in giving it. And by the way its to be obſerved,
<list>
                  <item>1. That a Power acquired, and held by force, cannot govern without a tacit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at leaſt, ſo that all Common-wealths are by conſent.</item>
                  <item>2. No man or men can govern any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple long by force, except it be the Will of God to puniſh and oppreſs them with an iron rod for their tranſgreſſions.</item>

               <hi>CAP. II.</hi> Of the Second Part, and the Eighteenth of the Book: Of the Rights of Soveraigns by Inſtitution.</head>
            <p>THis Chapter informs us, what the rights of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns once conſtituted are. In every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth there muſt be a ſupreme Power fixed in ſome certain Subject; this is eſſential to it: yet though this be a principal thing to be done, yet it is not all, neither being done, doth it make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Common-wealth. His Covenant of every one with every one for to deſign a Soveraign, is but an Utopian fancy. For by the beſt Hiſtories we may underſtand that many States have attained to a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led form of Regular Government by degrees in a long tract of time, and that by ſeveral alterations intervening; ſo that the Laws of their conſtitution are rather cuſtoms then any written Charter. Some Communities come under a form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more ſuddenly, and by a way fortuitous unto man, though not ſo to God. And in this point the practiſe of former times, not the fancies and ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of men muſt inſtruct us.</p>
            <p>T. H.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt of the twelve Rights of the Soveraign, is, That Subjects cannot change the form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:170310:12"/>
            <p>
               <hi>G. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Community which hath Power and Liberty to alter the form of Government to the better, do not their duty, or are not wiſe, if they do it not. And it were wiſdom in any people to reſerve the Power to the whole body, to be uſed as occaſion, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and neceſſity ſhall require. As they are bound to reform the State when it is corrupted, ſo they are bound to alter the form, when without an alteration reformation cannot be obtained.</p>
            <p>That the Subjects have no power to alter the form of Government may be granted: for Subjects as Subjects, muſt ſubmit unto the Power eſtabliſhed, not take upon them the higheſt and moſt tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Prerogative of all others: yet this is no right of the Soveraign, nor to be reckoned <hi>inter Jura Majeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi> For the Soveraign himſelf hath no right of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to change the fundamental conſtitution: Before this can be done, the People muſt return unto the original State of Liberty, and to a Community, which in <hi>England</hi> is not a Parliament, but the fourty Counties. Upon this ground ſome have ſaid that a Parliament cannot alter the Government; what men may do upon a Diſſolution, and in a caſe of real, not pretended neceſſity, is another matter. But let us hear his reaſons.</p>
            <p>T. H.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt upon ſuppoſition of no former Obligation, is, That it is a breach of that Covenant whereby they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170310:13"/>made themſelves authours of every act the ſoveraign doth, or ſhall judge fit to be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>2. <hi>If they depoſe the Soveraign, that which is his own, and they had formerly given him, they take away unjuſtly.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>If any attempting to depoſe his Soveraign, be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or puniſhed, he is Author of his own puniſhment.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. <hi>A new Covenant pretended to be made with God, cannot free them from offence and injuſtice in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience unto their Soveraign; becauſe they can make no Covenant with God, without his Leiutenant, which is the Prince.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>G. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I grant as formerly, that a Subject as ſuch, cannot act to change the Government, or depoſe his lawful Soveraign.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They who ſet up a Soveraign, and by Covenant advance him to the Throne, muſt and ought to be free from all former ſuperiour obligations, which cannot ſtand with this. But what is this to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? The queſtion is, whether Subjects cannot change the form of Government in any caſe, and whether the Subjects may not be freed, and that lawfully from their allegiance, and ceaſe to be in the State of Subjects? That it many times fals out ſo to be, is evident: For by civil wars, by forraign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions, tranſmigrations, and other wayes it comes to paſs, that Subjects are free from their Soveraigns, who cannot protect them; and in ſuch caſes, if God give them Power, they may alter the form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if it may be for the beſt.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:170310:13"/>
            <p>But to come more cloſe unto his firſt reaſon, let us ſuppoſe as he affirmeth, That a people by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant have ſet up a particular perſon to be a Monarch, and ſo made themſelves authors of all his acts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it lawful for you by a new Covenant to obey another, or caſt off Monarchy, or transfer his perſon upon another without injuſtice? He ſaith ye cannot without breach of Covenant do it.</p>
            <p>But
<list>
                  <item>1. He here preſuppoſeth his former Utopian fancy of a Covenant of every man with every man; whereas its plain, few States of the world now in power, were thus conſtituted.</item>
                  <item>2. Soveraigns are of two ſorts;
<list>
                        <item>1. Such as in whom the ſupreme power doth conſtantly and immediately abide.</item>
                        <item>2. Such as are ſuch only for execution and adminiſtration. To theſe latter, the ſubjects bind themſelves to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſo far as they ſhall be faithful to the Kingdom and the Crown, which is theirs, not <hi>[jurc dominii]</hi> by abſolute right, with a power to alienate them, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them. For every ſubject is firſt bound to be faithful to their Countrey, then unto their King, who ſwears to maintain the Laws, Liberty and Religion by Law eſtabliſhed. Theſe cannot bind us to do any thing againſt the Laws of God, of Nature, nor againſt our Countrey. But with this Author every Monarch is abſolute, and in particular the Kings of <hi>England</hi> amongſt the reſt.</item>

                  </item>
                  <item>3. Suppoſe a Covenant with a Soveraign, abſolute or limited, be againſt the Laws of God either moral or poſitive in force, may not the ſubjects break this Covenant without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice?

                  <item>5. To be obedient to another, to transfer his power, to depoſe him, is not to change the form of government, but to pull down one, and ſet up another, the form remaining the ſame.</item>
                  <item>6. Subjects or rather they who are ſubjects, as ſubjects, cannot make any ſuch Covenant, as to make one who was no Soveraign to be their Soveraign; If they can make a Soveraign, they muſt be equal, and equally free in making that Covenant where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a ſupreme Governour is conſtituted.</item>
                  <item>7. If they, who were <hi>[aequà liberi]</hi> before, and in the time of making this Covenant, and after it is concluded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſubjects, afterwards rebel, they ceaſe to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and become <hi>[hoſtes]</hi> enemies, and are ſo to be dealt withall: And what reaſon can be given why the Soveraign, if he prove a Tyrant in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, and challenge more power then was given him, or could by the Laws of God or Nature be conferred upon him, ſhould not ceaſe to be a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, and the ſubjects free from their allegiance to him, ſeeing he hath violated the eſſential part of the Covenant, and perverted the main end of all Government? Why ſhould it be otherwiſe in this then in all other pacts and contracts? This queſtion is the more difficult to be anſwered by this Author, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he allows the people a power to make a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign: and if he be ſuch as is one onely for admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, its unanſwerable.

                  <item>2. I deny that ſubjects do give any ſuch right.</item>

            <p>But in the end of this paragraph, he ſeems to take away the pretence and allegation of ſome new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters with God.

For that Covenant
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170310:15"/>could not give the leaſt power either to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> or any in either Nation, entering into it: and in the ſame they only engaged to uſe lawful means, to accompliſh what they had promiſed. Yet with him this and all other Covenants are void, if made with God without his Vicegerent, who is their Soveraign. Yet if this were true, then the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made in Baptiſm, by the converted Chriſtians under the heathen Emperours cannot be valid. This is evidently falſe, becauſe every man may voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bind himſelf to God in thoſe things wherein the Laws of God and man have left him free, without the conſent or expreſs permiſſion of his civil Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.</p>

            <p>This is the ſubſtance, though not all the words to prove that Soveraigns cannot forfeit. His 1. Reaſon
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170310:15"/>takes that for granted, which is falſe, and cannot be proved. For a community is one perſon moral by ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Law, as they uſe to ſpeak, or as the Civilians expreſs themſelves <hi>[perſona conjuncta]</hi> oppoſed to <hi>[ſingularis]</hi> For a community is the immediate ſubject of a Common-wealth, and muſt be aſſociate before they can be capable of a form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and without union and communion too, it cannot be <hi>civitas, ſocietas, populus.</hi> As thus united, it may act and covenant by their Deputies, who may be many, or by a Deputy, which may be one: and here they may in the name of the whole, Covenant with the perſon whom they like for Soveraign, and upon conditions juſt and reaſonable. Thus <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a meer community, makes <hi>Moſes</hi> their Deputy and Mediator, to Covenant with God in their behalf. Thus the ten Tribes by ſome of their principal men capitulate with <hi>Jeroboam.</hi> Thus the <hi>Gileadites</hi> by their Meſſengers offer to contract with <hi>Jephtah,</hi> and ſome of the Tribes make the ſame offer unto <hi>Gideon.</hi> Thus a free people may inveſt one man or more ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with original power, or truſt him and them only with the adminiſtration. And they may put conditions upon them, either to give them an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited or limited power, as the wiſeſt men amongſt them ſhall think fit. And there is great reaſon ſo to do: For,
<list>
                  <item>1. They are free.</item>
                  <item>2. He with whom they purpoſe to contract, hath no right to command them, no power over them before he be made Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign: He is but a private perſon, and they are mad men if they will ſubject themſelves upon unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conditions: They are very unwiſe, who will make a Butcher their Shepherd, or ſet a Woolf over
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170310:16"/>their Flocks.</item>
               </list>
And ſurely its no point of wiſdom in any free-people, to truſt any one man, or aſſembly of men, with an abſolute unlimited power. If an enemy come in by conqueſt, they muſt be content with what conditions he pleaſeth, not with ſuch as they deſire. For they are not free, becauſe their eſtates, liberty, lives are in his power; As for the Covenant of every one with every one, its a meer <hi>Chimera:</hi> there was never any ſuch thing, neither can he give any inſtance of it, and therefore all that he builds upon it muſt needs fall.</p>
            <p>As for his ſecond reaſon, wherein he affirms Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants to be but words, and words are but breath and of no force, without a publike ſword, its no waies tolerable. By theſe words he may be proved to be an Atheiſt, whatſoever he pretends, and to deny the immortality of the ſoul, all Religion and fear of the Deity, and his providence over the world, and I ſhould be very unwilling to truſt his promiſe upon oath, for any thing I could not recover by Law. The principal force of a Covenant depends upon the will and conſent of the immortal ſoul, which fears a Deity, and believes a ſupreme Judge of the world, who will render to every man according to their works; yet becauſe Covenants are but words and breath, therefore he inferrs</p>

            <p>Its true, that we are ignorant fools, if we think, when a Monarch is made ſuch upon condition to which he is ſworn, that he will part with his power, though he hath forfeited his right unto it: if he have a long ſword, and a broad conſcience, he will be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor as long as he can. And by this paſſage he ſeems to affirm, that few Monarchs have any conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or fear of God: For though they loſe their right, yet they will not part with their poſſeſſion, though their own conſcience, Laws of God, and the dictates of nature perſwade them to keep their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, and not violate their Oaths. In a word, though Soveraigns be made by Covenant and Oath yet the Obligation is in vain, becauſe the people can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not force them to the obſervation thereof: for they have parted with their power, and delivered the ſword unto their Governors; Yet they never gave them the ſword to maintain their injuſtice, but to protect the juſt and puniſh the unjuſt. Yet in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular State this ſeems to be clear; That the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign cannot be made upon condition; for thus he writes,</p>
            <p>T. H.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No man is ſo dull as to ſay, for example, The people of</hi> Rome <hi>made a Covenant with the</hi> Romans <hi>to hold the Soveraignty on ſuch or ſuch conditions, which not performed, the</hi> Romans <hi>might lawfully depoſe the</hi> Roman <hi>people. That men ſee not the reaſon to be

            <p>
               <hi>G. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men are not ſo dull as to believe that the reaſon of not forfeiting the ſupreme power is alike in a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy and a Popular State; For we know that in ſuch a Common-wealth, the Community and the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign are the ſame, though in ſome reſpect different; but in a Monarchy or Ariſtocraty its far otherwiſe. In the State of <hi>Rome,</hi> after that <hi>Tarquin</hi> was depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and that Government reduced unto a Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, every one ſeverally, though never ſo great, was a ſubject: and all joyntly was their Soveraign: for in that form <hi>[ſinguli ſubduntur univerſis, &amp; univerſi praeſunt ſingulis]</hi> yet the univerſality of the people, as a Community, could not act and exerciſe the Soveraignty, and therefore Conſuls and other Officers were truſted with great power, but not with the ſupreme: and theſe might forfeit and be depoſed by the people. In all States we muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the conſtitution and the adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or as others uſe to expreſs themſelves <hi>[Inter Statum &amp; exercitium.]</hi> They who are truſted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the adminiſtration, as ſuch, are not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, though they will endeavour to uſurp and poſſeſs that power. Therefore the Authoreither is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ignorant, or elſe goes about to delude his ignorant Reader.</p>
            <p>The queſtion therefore is, whether a Soveraign may forfeit? That he cannot, is not at all, by ſo much as a probable argument yet evinced.
<list>
                  <item>1. That he
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170310:17"/>may forfeit unto God there is no doubt.</item>
                  <item>2. That if any forfeit, God will in his due time take the forfeit, paſs Judgement upon the party forfeiting, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the ſame, either by himſelf, or by Angels, or by forrein forces, or by civil wars, or ſome other way; and in all this God is juſt, though men may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.</item>

For ſuch, as ſuch, are <hi>hoſtes humani generis,</hi> rebels againſt God, and agents for the Devil. All powers are ordained of God, and from him they receive Commſſion to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect their ſubjects, not deſtroy them, and to puniſh the bad, not to protect them and advance them, and uſe them for the deſtruction of the good.

And in doubtful matters, men

Others affirm, That in a mixt State, they of neceſſity muſt; in a pure State, they muſt not be either diviſible, or communicable. This point may be made more clear,

And all theſe branches are reducible to three; For ſupreme power civil is, Legiſlative, Judicial, Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as before; and becauſe it extends to theſe three acts, therefore it may be ſaid to be threefold. And all theſe rights reckoned up by him, which are ſuch indeed, are contained under theſe three, though nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he nor other Authors have much obſerved it. Amongſt theſe the Legiſlative is the principal, not only the firſt but the chiefeſt, yet the other are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, becauſe without them its in vain; for what are Laws without Judgement and Execution? yet even the Laws regulate both. And to know who are Soveraign in any act, the only infallible way is by the Legiſlation. For in whomſoever the Legiſlative power originally is, he or they are ſupreme; for it is not the actual making of certain rules to order all things in a State, but the giving of a binding force unto them, which makes the Soveraign.</p>
            <p>This power, not only as it is a power, but as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, cannot be divided. For if you take any eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential part from it, you deſtroy it, ſo that its indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in it ſelf. 2. In reſpect of the ſubject: For whether the ſubject be the Community, or the Opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, they muſt be conſidered as one perſon moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though they be many phyſically: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, they muſt go all together, otherwiſe there can be no firſt mover in a State; for it is one ſupreme power in it ſelf, and muſt alſo be in one ſubject: yet for the adminiſtration it may be divided: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Soveraign doth exerciſe this power, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170310:20"/>acts ſeverally by ſeveral Officers, which are but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments animated and acted by him.

            <p>The cauſe moral of theſe wars, was our ſins: the Political cauſe was the male-adminiſtration; yet ſo, that all ſides have offended through want of wiſdom, and many other waies. The ignorance of Politicks in general, and of our own conſtitution in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, cannot be excuſed or excepted; What the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient conſtitution was, we know not certainly, though ſome reliques of the ſame continued till our times: but the whole frame was ſtrangely altered and corrupted. Many different opinions there be concerning our Government; yet three amongſt the reſt are moſt remarkable: For one party con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the King to be an abſolute Monarch: A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond determines, the King, Peers, and Commons to be three co-ordinate powers, yet ſo that ſome of them grant three Negatives, ſome only two: A third party give diſtinct rights unto theſe three: yet
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170310:21"/>in this they are ſub-divided, and they would be thought to be more rational, who give the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power unto the Lords and Commons in one houſe; the judicial, to the Lords in a diſtinct houſe, and the executive to the King, who was therefore truſted with the Sword both of War and Juſtice: None of theſe can give ſatisfaction. There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinion, which puts the ſupreme power radical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the 40. Counties, to be exerciſed by King, Peers and Commons, according to certain rules, which by Antiquaries in Law, together with ſome experienced States-men of this Nation, might be found out, but are not. The ſeeds of this diviſion were ſown and begun to appear before the wars; and the opinion, that all theſe were only in one man, that is the King abſolutely, ſome ſay, was the greateſt cauſe, not only of the laſt, but alſo of other civil wars in former times: And it hath been obſerved, that every man liked that opinion beſt, which was moſt ſuitable to his own intereſt. Our ſeveral opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in Religion have heightened our differences, and hindered our ſettlement; yet Religion is but pretended; for every party aims at civil power, not ſpiritual liberty from ſin. And the power to ſettle us thus wofully diſtracted, is only in God; and if he ever will be thus merciful unto us, the way whereby he will effect it, will be by giving the greateſt power to men of greateſt wiſdom and integrity, not by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing us unto one opinion, that all the powers civil muſt be in one, as the Author doth fondly fancy: Let the form be the beſt in the world, yet without good Governors its in vain.</p>

            <p>This is conceived to be a diſtribution into ſpecies or kinds; yet if we throughly examine it, it is not ſo; for its but an accidential difference: For it ariſeth only from the diſtinct and different manner of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſing the ſupreme power, in one or more. In more, and theſe are the [Optimates] ſome of the beſt and moſt eminent, or in the whole Community. Yet in all theſe the eſſential acts of Government (and ſo the Soveraign power) are the ſame in all States: and they are, as you heard before three, Legiſlation, Judgement and Execution; for its meerly accidental to the ſupremacy to be diſpoſed more or more. That it muſt be diſpoſed in ſome certain ſuch ſect is neceſſary; and that as the Supremacy is one and indiviſible, ſo the ſubject muſt be one alſo, and that either phyſically or morally: The great variety of Common-wealths, which is ſuch, that there be not two in the whole world in all things like, ariſeth not from the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but from the different manner of adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Though the Author denies all mixt Common-wealths; yet wiſe and learned men, which without diſparagement to him, may be preferred before him, as in other things, ſo in State-learning, have ſaid,

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170310:22"/>he never truly underſtood them, neither hath he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of the difference between Real and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Majeſty; or of the Natural or Ethical ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Supremacy, or of the exerciſe thereof by certain perſons, and the conſtant inherency of it in a certain ſubject. And we know by experience, that ſuch as are only truſted with the exerciſe of ſupreme power, will by little and little uſurp it, and in the end plead preſcription. So <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11. of <hi>France,</hi> when he violated the Laws of the conſtitution, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved all ſuch as by right ought to have poyſed him, could boaſt, That he had freed the Crown from Wardſhip. And this hath been the practiſe of the Princes of Europe, which in the end will prove their ruine, as for the preſent it hath been their trouble. There is no Common-wealth, but may be reduced to one of theſe three, in ſome reſpect; yet ſo, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies differ as much from one another, as they differ from the other two: Some are regal, ſome deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical; and there be ſeveral ſorts of theſe. But I do not intend at this time to conteſt with him about this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution but proceed.</p>

               <hi>Tyrannie and Oligarchy are but different names of Monarchy and Ariſtocracy, not different forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments.</hi>

            <p>Theſe names do not ſignifie <hi>Chimera's,</hi> but real Entities; and if any have abuſed them to ſignifie
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170310:23"/>forms of Government, let them anſwer for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; I know them not, they cannot be men of any note; Tyrannie doth not ſignifie Monarchy, nor Oligarchy an Ariſtocracy. They ſignifie the vicious corruption of States degenerate from their original conſtitution, and that by the wickedneſs of a Prince, and the faction of an aſſembly ingroſſing power, and enhanſing it above that which is due and juſt, and ſo become a multitude of Tyrants; and this hath been the cauſe, why many Nations, when they had power in their own hands, have altered the form of Government, been jealous of truſting one man or aſſembly of men long with too much power, and the wiſeſt have ſet their wits on the rack, to find out a way, how to limit and reſtrain the power of their Governors.</p>

               <hi>Subordinate Repreſentatives are dangerous: And I know not how that ſo manifeſt a truth ſhould of late be ſo little obſerved, that in a Monarchy, he that had the Soveraignty from a deſcent of</hi> 600. <hi>years, was alone called Soveraign, had the title of Majeſty from every one of his ſubjects, and was unqueſtionably taken by them for their King, was notwithſtanding never conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as their Repreſentative: that name without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, paſsing for the title of thoſe men, which at his command, were ſent up by the people to carry their petitions, and give him (if he permitted) their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This man deſerves to be a perpetual ſlave; his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is to make men believe, that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> were abſolute Monarchs, their ſubjects ſlaves, without propriety of goods, or liberty of perſon, the Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> meerly nothing but ſhadows, and the members thereof but ſo many carriers of letters and petitions between home and the Court; What he means by ſubordinate Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, I know not; I think his intention is to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thoſe, who affirmed King, Peers, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to be co-ordinate, not ſubordinate powers, and all of them joyntly to make up one ſupreme; Subordinate Repreſentatives or powers he may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and muſt grant in all States. The word Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, he either doth not underſtand, or if he do, he intolerably abuſeth his unwary and unlearned Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by that term. A Repreſentative in the Civil Law, called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is one who by his preſence ſupplies the place of another that is abſent, for ſome certain end, as to act that which another ſhould do, but in his own perſon doth not, yet with the conſent of the perſon repreſented, ſo far as that the thing is judged to be done by him. And in this ſenſe, the perſon repreſenting, is Judged to be one with the perſon repreſented by fiction of Law. And one may repreſent another as a Superiour, who may repreſent another in any act, ſo far as that other is in his power: or as an inferiour, by a power derived from his ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour; or as an equal by conſent, ſo far as the perſon
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170310:24"/>will undertake to act for him. In all theſe repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, the <hi>Repreſenteé</hi> and the Repreſenter are judged one perſon. In a free-State, a Parliament is a Repreſentative of the whole body of the people; this we call a general Repreſentative. The reaſon of this repreſentation is, becauſe the whole body of a people cannot well act perſonally. What kind of Repreſentative the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> was, is hard to know, except we knew certainly the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, which, by tract of time, and many abuſes of that excellent Aſſembly, is now unknown. It was certainly truſted with the higheſt acts of Legiſlation, Judgement, Execution. The whole body conſiſted of ſeveral orders and ranks of men, as of King, Peers, Commons, the Clergy. Whether they might meddle with the conſtitution or no, is not ſo clear; its conceived they could not alter it, though they might declare it what it was. Their power was great without all doubt, yet not ſo great, but that it was bounded, and a later Parliament might alter and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what a former had eſtabliſhed, which argues, That the 40. Counties, and the whole body of the people whence all Parliaments have their original and being, as they are Parliaments, were above them. In this great aſſembly, the Knights and Burgeſſes did repreſent the Connties and the Burroughs; the Convocation, the whole body of the Clergy; the Peers, by antient tenure, their Families, Vaſſals, and Dependants. But whom the King ſhould repreſent is hard to determine. If the Law did conſider him as an infant, and this according to the conſtitution, he could repreſent no other perſon or perſons. And if this be ſo, then there is plain reaſon why he never
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170310:24"/>ſhould have the title of Repreſentative; yet evident reaſon there is, why the reſt ſhould be called a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative: and the people are not Repreſenters, as he fondly imagines, but the perſons repreſented.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Our Government is called a Monarchy] is true, and he himſelf in this Chapter confeſſeth that Elective limited Kings are called Monarchs, and their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms Monarchies; yet he ſaith, they are not ſo. Again, Monarchy is Regal over free-men, Deſpotical over ſlaves and ſervants, not by a Legal but an Arbitrary power. If he ſay its Regal, then the King is no abſolute Monarch as he would have him to be. If he ſay its Deſpotical, its falſe, and we know it ſo to be falſe. And the Doctrine of Dr. <hi>Sibthorp,</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nering,</hi> or <hi>Martin,</hi> affirming this, was condemned by a whole Parliament, and that by men who have been as great Zealots for the King in theſe civil wars as any other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The King of <hi>England</hi> had Soveraignty by a deſcent of 600. years;] But firſt, what doth he mean by Soveraignty? If he underſtand an abſolute ſupreme power, its not true: the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have no ſuch thing. Its true, that many of them did challenge ſo much power as they could acquire and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170310:25"/>keep; and as their ſword was longer or ſhorter, ſo their power in poſſeſſion was more or leſs. Yet by the conſtitution of Law, and the beſt cuſtom, it was alwaies determined within certain bounds. Secondly, Whence will he commence the date of 600. years? and how will he derive the Soveraignty? If from the Conqueror, the date of ſo many years is not yet expired, &amp; the Succeſſion is interrupted, if not cut off by the ſword upon a civil war. If he derive this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from the Conqueror as Conqueror; all free Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh men will deny it; the Kings themſelves durſt not challenge it upon thoſe terms, and by conſent they never had it. Therefore the Soveraignty, the time of the commencement, the title it ſelf doth vaniſh. He ſaith ſomething, proves nothing; that he was called Soveraign, doth neither prove that he was really ſuch, nor that he was abſolute, and that by his own confeſſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The King had the title of Majeſty from every one of his ſubjects] The title or name doth not prove the thing: for we know very well, that the title is conſtantly given to divers Princes who have not the thing, no more then our Kings had the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>France,</hi> though they had the title of the Kings of <hi>France: France</hi> was ſo civil as to grant the title and the word, but never part with the thing. The Dukes of <hi>Venice</hi> (as <hi>Contarene</hi> tells us) had <hi>inſignia ſed non poteſtatem regis. Majeſtas</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>maxima dignitas,</hi> and this no ſubject denyed to the King. He had his Scepter and his Throne, his Robe and Diadem; but all theſe are far ſhort of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power: <hi>Majeſtas</hi> is <hi>Perſonalis aut Realis.</hi> Real he had not, Perſonal he might have. Yet perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170310:25"/>Majeſty might be his either in reſpect of dignity, as it was, or in reſpect of power; and that alſo two waies; either in reſpect of the whole power, and all the acts thereof; or 2. in reſpect of the executive only, ſo far as that all Commiſſions, Judgements, Executions determined by Law, ſhould run in his name, as they did. I remember I have read in the <hi>Mirrour</hi> ſomething to this purpoſe, That in the firſt conſtitution of this Government of <hi>England,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> the 40. Counts, of the 40. Shires or Counties ſet up a King above them, ſo that he had neither any one his Superiour, nor his Peer; Yet <hi>ex obligatione criminis,</hi> by his miſ-government the 40. Counts joyntly together might judge him, whether in their own names, or the name of the 40. Counties, may be a queſtion. And in this ſenſe I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is to be underſtood that ſaying, <hi>Rex ſingulis major, univerſis minor.</hi> Let theſe things be ſo or no, (for they are out of my ſphere) its certain the Kings of <hi>England</hi> had the title of Majeſty, yet thats no argument at all that he was inveſted with the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and univerſal power.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He was unqueſtionably taken by them for their King.] I grant he both was ſo taken, and was ſo truly and indeed. And when our Kings were ſuch as were more tender of the peoples good, then their own greatneſs, and alſo governed by the direction of a wiſe and faithful Council, they found them the moſt loving and loyal ſubjects of any in the world. For the Engliſh alwaies deſired to be governed as men, not as Aſſes. And this is the quality of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding people of other Nations. Some are not capable either of a mild, or moderate power.</p>

One of our learned Biſhops
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170310:27"/>in his anſwer to <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who affirmed Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Government was the beſt, and therefore the Government of the Church muſt be ſuch, ſaith, that purple is the beſt colour, yet not the beſt for the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals face, ſo it is in this caſe. No man (I think) can demonſtrate the Government of Angels to be Monarchical. There may be amongſt thoſe bleſſed ſpirits <hi>primatus ordinis,</hi> not <hi>juriſdictionis.</hi> We do not read that God did ever immediately inſtitute a form of Government to any people except to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> yet that was not Monarchical. And though Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy were ſuppoſed to be the beſt, yet wiſe men ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the opportunity, did never inſtitute that form of Government which in it ſelf was beſt, but the beſt the people were capable of. I am no enemy to Monarchy, and I deſire all Chriſtian States to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with their preſent form of Government, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they may enjoy peace and the Goſpel. If di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence bring them into ſuch a condition, as that they muſt, or may lawfully and ſafely alter, let them uſe their utmoſt power to make the alteration ſo, that it may be a reformation. To endeavour a change in a quiet State, and that out of ambition, or an humour of innovation, or an high conceit of their own State-learning, will much offend God, and bring great miſery on man. Alterations in Government, which though they be for the better, if ſudden, are dangerous: and ſhould be made inſenſibly and by little and little; yet ſo, that if there be any thing in the former old conſtitution, which is good, it ſhould be retained; what wiſe Polititians have done in this kind, Hiſtories inform us; as in <hi>England</hi> if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170310:27"/>which ſo many excellent Lawyers have ſo highly commended, as next unto the eternal Law, were introduced, it would prove a wonderful <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium</hi> in the regulation of Juſtice, and cut off a world of uſeleſs Statutes, which are rather an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, then a furtherance to Juſtice. There may be many forms of Government, and all good, yet its certain, that is the beſt, which provides moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually for good Officers in the adminiſtration. If we may believe <hi>Contzen</hi> the Jeſuite, There are amongſt others, in the conſtitution of the Empire of <hi>China,</hi> two excellent rules conſtantly put in practiſe; The one is an Office or Colledge, whoſe duty is to inform the King of his errours, and never to ceaſe petitioning in the name of the people, till he reform, and return to the obſervation of the Laws. Theſe alſo inform the King of the miſcarriage of all other Officers, though never ſo great. The other rule and practiſe is, every third year to make a ſevere and rigid inquiſition into the adminiſtration of all Magiſtrates, and to put out and puniſh the unjuſt, negligent, and unworthy, and to eſtabliſh the juſt.</p>
            <p>The Author endeavours to prove the excellency of Monarchy above other forms, becauſe it hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies proper to it ſelf, and is free from inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies incident to Ariſtocratical and Democratical States. Yet this is to little purpoſe. For,

               <hi>CAP. IV.</hi> Of the Second Part, the twentieth of the Book, of Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and Deſpotical Dominion.</head>
            <p>THE method of Politicks is miſerably perverted by the Author. For whereas power is firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired before a Common-wealth can be conſtituted, he firſt informs us of the ſeveral kinds of Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which ariſe from the different manner of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the power acquired, and after that of ſeveral waies how the power is acquired. And further to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray his ignorance of the rules of Government, he confounds Oeconomical power with Political, ſo that I may truly ſay, that he is one of the worſt that ever wrote either of Civil or Eccleſiaſtical Politicks.</p>
            <p>In this Chapter he undertakes,
<list>
                  <item>1. To define a Common-wealth by acquiſition, and to ſhew the difference between it, and that by conſtitution.</item>
                  <item>2. To declare how dominion is acquired.</item>
                  <item>3. To prove the Soveraign rights out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</item>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:170310:28"/>
                  <item>4. From thence to demonſtrate that all Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign power is abſolute.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>T. H.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Common-wealth by acquiſition, is that where the Soveraign power is acquired by force — And the difference of this from that of conſtitution is, that in the former, men ſubject themſelves for fear of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign. in the latter for fear of one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the ſubſtance, though not all his words, where we muſt obſerve, That this is no diſtinction of a Common-wealth, but of the manner how the power, whereby any is made a Soveraign, is acquired: and that all Soveraigns do one way or other acquire their power: for its meerly accidental, no waies eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to any man, for to be inveſted with power. And howſoever the Soveraignty civil be obtained, it makes no difference in the Common-wealth. For in every ſtate the power is acquired, and ſo there is no Common-wealth but its both by acquiſition and conſtitution too. So that he hath made a diſtinction without a difference.</p>
            <p>T. H.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dominion is acquired two waies, by Generation and Conqueſt: The firſt is Paternal, the latter is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotical.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:170310:29"/>
            <p>
               <hi>G. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is very defective, as in this place its heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and impertinent. What have we to do with Family-power in a Common-wealth? For Familes as they make vicinities, and vicinities a Community civil, are but a remote material part of Politicks. In a Family there is a threefold power acquired; the power of an husband over his wife by marriage, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant or contract, the power of parents over their children, by generation; the power of Maſters over their ſervants, acquired ſeveral waies; for ſome ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are ſlaves, ſome are free; Slaves are <hi>vernae,</hi> ſervants born in the Family: or <hi>emptitii,</hi> bought with money: ſuch as are free be <hi>conductitii:</hi> The two former are more ſubject then the laſt; and the Maſter hath more power over the former ſort who are born and bought, then over the latter, who are only hired. So that there is a difference of Deſpoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal power even in a Family; the one is more abſolute, the other more limited.</p>
            <p>Soveraignty civil is acquired ſeveral waies, and all may be reduced to two. For men come unto this power either juſtly or unjuſtly. Juſtly, and that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in an extraordinary way, as by ſpecial unction and deſignation from God: thus <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Davids</hi> lawful Succeſſors of his Family were made (the two firſt by particular nomination, the other by ageneral entail) or in an ordinary manner, and that is either by the Law of Nature, or by inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. By the Law of Nature, when a multitude ſufficient for their own protection and government,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170310:29"/>aſſociate and by union and communion become a Community, the Soveraignty is virtually and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently in themſelves, and in the whole body of the people being free: and this is ſo natural a ſubject, that upon the defect of ſucceſſion, it returns unto them again. By inſtitution and more formal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract; and that is by a free and full election, or by a ſubmiſſion to a Conquerer, which is ſo far volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, that if they had power to protect themſelves, they would not ſubmit. Unjuſtly by uſurpation, when he or they who have no right, yet take the poſſeſſion into their own hands in a way contrary to the Laws of God, and the conſent of men: yet ſuch an Uſurper cannot be a Soveraign without ſome kind of conſent of God and man. In this caſe fraud or force gets the advantage over the people ſo far, as that they muſt ſubmit or do worſe. When any aſcend the Throne by Marriage, Succeſſion; Election, they are made Governors by inſtitution, with free and full conſent. In all this I ſpeak of the ſupreme, not the ſubordinate power, which is by Commiſsion derived from the ſupreme. In all theſe waies of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring power, we muſt diſtinguiſh between power of conſtitution in conſtitution, and in adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and alſo take ſpecial notice that there is no power which can govern without conſent not only of man, but alſo and eſpecially of God, who either in juſtice and ſeverity, or in mercy doth change and alter the Kingdoms of the world at will and pleaſure. For he alone doth rule in heaven and earth at all times.</p>
            <p>Thus far concerning the acquiſition of power, and of the <hi>[jura majeſtatis]</hi> rights of Soveraigns, which he conceives to have made clear by reaſon, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170310:30"/>now in the next place undertakes to prove out of Scripture, yet in ſuch a looſe and implous abuſive manner, that I verily perſwade my ſelf, he doth not believe them to be revealed and written from heaven, or that Jeſus Chriſt was an ordinary juſt man, much leſs the Eternal Son of God incarnate.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Lets now conſider what the Scripture teacheth in the ſame point: To</hi> Moſes <hi>the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſay thus, Speak thou to us, and we will hear thee: but let not God ſpeak to us, leſt we die. This is abſolute obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to</hi> Moſes.</p>

               <hi>G. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the firſt Scripture alledged by him; we read it in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.19. To underſtand theſe words, we muſt conſider,
<list>
                  <item>1. That <hi>cap.</hi> 19.8. That all the people anſwered together, and ſaid, All that the Lord hath ſaid, that will we do. This was an abſolute ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of themſelves to God, and a promiſe to obey him.</item>
                  <item>2. That the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I ſpeak with thee, and believe thee for ever, <hi>Verſe</hi> 9. This was to procure authority and credit unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> as a Meſſenger between God and <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. That the words of <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.19. quoted by the Author, are expounded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.27. For thus there we read, Go thou near, and hear all that the Lord our God ſhall ſay: and ſpeak thou unto us all that the Lord our God ſhall ſpeak to thee, and we will
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170310:30"/>hear it and do it.</item>
               </list>
From all which it is apparent,
<list>
                  <item>1. That the people had formerly before they ſpake theſe words, ſubjected themſelves to God: and he was their Soveraign, not <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. That they promiſe to obey the words of God declared by <hi>Moſes,</hi> not as they were the words and Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but of God, they will do them.</item>
                  <item>3. That they promiſe to believe <hi>Moſes</hi> as a Meſſenger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and them, not obey him as their ſupreme Lord.</item>
               </list>
Its one thing to believe <hi>Moſes</hi> as a Prophet from God, and to yield him abſolute obedience as a King. Believe him as a Prophet they might, obey him as their King they muſt not. God was their King, and <hi>Moſes</hi> his Meſſenger and ſervant. How groſly therefore doth he abuſe the place? how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly and falſly doth he thence infer the peoples pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of abſolute obedience to <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly due and promiſed unto God?</p>

               <hi>Concerning the right of Kings, God himſelf by the mouth of</hi> Samuel <hi>ſaith, This ſhall be the right of the King you will have to raign over you, he ſhall take your ſons,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.11, 12, &amp;c.</p>

                  <item>1. The tranſlation, which he confeſſed is allowed by his Soveraign and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. For inſtead of This will be the manner of the King, he turns it, This ſhall be the right of the King. There is a great difference between right which is alwaies juſt, and manner or cuſtom, which
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170310:31"/>is many times unjuſt.</item>
                  <item>2. If this be a prerogative of Soveraigns, then its a very great miſery to be ſubject to a King; and that in two reſpects.
<list>
                        <item>1. Becauſe he will take away from his ſubjects unjuſtly, that which juſtly is their own, even the beſt things.</item>
                        <item>2. Becauſe by doing thus, he will oppreſs them ſo grievouſly, that having no remedy or redreſs from man, they will cry unto God for deliverance from a King, as a great and intolerable miſchief.</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. If it be the right of a King, yet it is but the right of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Deſpotical Princes, and not of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But how can it be the right of heathen Kings, ſeeing they had no power to oppreſs and do wrong?</item>
                  <item>4. It could not be the right of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> for they were bound to act and judge according to the Laws God had made; yet theſe acts here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, are directly contrary to thoſe Laws and Rules of Regal Government, delivered by God himſelf. For he muſt have a copy of the Laws, and read in it all his life, that he may fear God, keep his Laws, not exalt himſelf above his Brethren, <hi>&amp;c. Deut.</hi> 17.18, 19, 20. Neither did the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> or <hi>Iſrael,</hi> no not wicked <hi>Ahab</hi> practiſe or make uſe of this power, as is evident in the caſe of <hi>Naboths</hi> Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.</item>
                  <item>5. To do according to this power pretended in this place, is directly contrary to the very end of all Government civil, which is to do juſtice and judgement, to preſerve to every one his own, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the good, and puniſh the bad. How ſhall he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Oppreſſor, when he is the great Oppreſſor himſelf? How can he do juſtice upon thieves, when he is the greateſt thief in his Kingdom?</item>
                  <item>6. If this ſhould be the right of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170310:31"/>all Soveraigns, then though the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were a free people, yet if a King was once ſet over them, they were meer ſlaves: neither their Lands, nor their goods, nor their children, nor their ſervants were their own; and alſo by this reaſon, there can be no ſubjects in any ſtate under heaven, that can have propriety or liberty, but all are meer and abſolute ſervants and ſlaves. Kings may have <hi>potentiam,</hi> but not <hi>poteſtatem,</hi> force and fraud, but no juſt power to oppreſs their ſubjects, and do ſuch things as are here mentioned. Whereas ſome ſay, That God in this place teacheth us what Kings may do, and in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18, 19, 20. what they ought to do, is to little purpoſe, as being more acute then ſolid. For <hi>id quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que poteſt, quod jure poteſt.</hi> And no man, no not the greateſt Princes in the world, have any power to do that which is unjuſt.</item>
                  <item>7. Its a queſtion whether they had ſuch a King as they deſired. For they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a King which would offend God, and oppreſs them: but God gave them ſuch a King as had no power to make Laws, but ſuch as were bound to Judge according to the civil or judicial Laws made by himſelf; and even in the time of Kings, he reſerved the Soveraign Rights in his own hand.</item>
               </list>
It ſeems they underſtood not well, what kind of King they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired; for to maintain the ſtate and pomp of a great Court, and an army in conſtant pay, was a vaſt charge, and required ſuch a revenue as could no waies be raiſed without the great oppreſſion of the people. And this they did not conſider, neither would underſtand till it was too late, and the yoak was upon their necks, and the burden preſſed them very ſore. When Princes are truſted with an abſolute
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170310:32"/>power to raiſe men and moneys at their will and pleaſure, they will not be content with the ordinary Revenue of their Crowns, but what they cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain juſtly by the Laws, and the conſtitution of the State, they will force by the ſword, and ſo the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment proves military, and in the end meerly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary. Whereas Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> conceives, That to go in and out before them, and Judge the people, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains as abſolute a power of the Militia and Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as one man can poſſibly transfer unto another, he is much deceived. For both theſe may be had in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotical, or a Regal way, or by Commiſſion. The firſt is abſolute, the two latter are not ſo. The Kings of <hi>Sparta, Poland, Arraegon,</hi> might have both theſe, and yet be no abſolute Soveraigns.</p>
            <p>T. H.</p>
            <p>Solomon <hi>prayed that God would give him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to judge his people, and diſcern between good and evil,</hi> 1 Kings 3.8. <hi>therefore he had the Judicial and Legiſlative power ſupreme and abſolute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is his meaning, and thus he underſtands theſe words, wherein we may obſerve,
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Solomons</hi> place and duty as King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that was to judge that people.</item>
                  <item>2. That this duty could not be well performed without wiſdom.</item>
                  <item>3. God doth give wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for that purpoſe: Theſe things are implyed.</item>
                  <item>4. <hi>Solomon</hi> praſes for wiſdom to that end. Neither from his place or prayer will it follow that he had the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170310:32"/>ſupreme, abſolute, legiſlative power in himſelf alone: Neither indeed had he any ſuch thing at all, for God had made the Laws both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical.</item>
               </list>
And he could neither alter or abrogate them, but was bound preciſely and ſtrictly to judge according to them, and neither depart unto the right hand or the left. And ſuppoſe <hi>Solomon</hi> had been inveſted with this power, doth it therefore follow that all other Kings have the like?</p>
            <p>The reſt which follow are not worthy any anſwer. He inſtanceth,
<list>
                  <item>1. In <hi>Saul,</hi> whom being their Lords annointed, <hi>David</hi> did not ſlay, though he was in his power. And what follows hence, but only thus much, That no man in <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, and of <hi>Davids</hi> conſcience, dare ſecretly put to death a King an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed by Gods ſpecial and immediate Word.</item>
                  <item>2. Servants muſt obey their Maſters, and Children their Parents in all things. And what is this to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? Doth it hence follow, that all Kings have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power? what impertinent and abſurd illations are theſe? But,</item>
                  <item>3. Chriſts Diſciples muſt obſerve and do all that the Scribes and Phariſees bid them, as ſitting in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair. From hence it cannot be concluded, that they had Soveraign power civil, no more then Miniſters of the Goſpel have it, becauſe the people muſt obſerve and do all that they bid them out of the Goſpel.</item>

How many plain and expreſs places of Scripture might have been produced to prove that there is a Legiſlative, Judicial, Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power in every State, and that it is to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by ſome certain perſons deſigned for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe?

            <p>This I read in the margent; and to his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, its plain both from reaſon and Scripture, that its as great as poſſibly a man can be imagined to make it: This is plainly ridiculous. For what can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not men imagine; ſeeing their imaginations can reach to wonders, impoſſibilities, and many things far above a civil Soveraign power? And here is a ſit oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion offered, to examine what abſolute power is, and in what reſpect Soveraignty is abſolute. There is no power, as there is no being abſolute, but that of Gods, whoſe power is his being. Civil ſupreme power is ſaid to be abſolute, becauſe its <hi>ſoluta legibus,</hi> free from the Laws, and not limited and obliged by them. Yet the Laws from which they are free, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above them, are only civil Laws made by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for the adminiſtration of the States where they are Soveraign. For they are ſo ſtrictly bound by the Law of Reaſon, Nature, God, which are but all one divine Law, as they have not the leaſt power to do any thing either as private perſons, or publike Soveraigns againſt them, except they will dethrone themſelves, provoke the wrath of God, and bring his Judgements upon them. They are beſides, ſubject to the Law of Nature, which is above any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Soveraign, though never ſo great. They are
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170310:34"/>indeed above their own Laws, and may not only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many things in them, but abrogate them. Yet ſo as all this tends to the publick good. They may act upon occaſion, above and beſides them, as the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good ſhall require it. They are not bound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to formalities, but may omit them. Yet all this is but little, and confined to the narrow compaſs of things indifferent, as they are ſubordinate to pure morals. Its true, that their power is in ſome reſpect arbitrary; yet if they do any thing which either in it ſelf, or in the circumſtances only is unjuſt, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and tranſgreſs the bounds God hath put unto their power. And here we muſt diſtinguiſh between the Soveraign for the Conſtitution, and the Soveraign for Adminiſtration. The former hath more power then the later, who only is above the Laws of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, yet both muſt be juſt; for they have no power to be unjuſt. Its certain that Princes deſire to be Gods, abſolute, independent, above all Laws, and to have a priviledge to do what they liſt, and a right to do wrong; and its a dangerous thing to flatter them, and make them believe their power to be greater, then indeed it is; for this is the very high-way unto ruine. Wiſe men have adviſed all Princes to obſerve their own Laws made by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and by their example encourage their ſubjects to obedience. And this is an effectual means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their ſafety, and confirm them in their power, and the love of their ſubjects.</p>

            <head>
               <hi>CAP. V.</hi> Of the Second Part, the one and twentieth of the Book, Of the liberty of ſubjects.</head>
            <p>THE ſubject of this Chapter is, as in the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the liberty of ſubjects, which follows the power of Soveraigns in this diſcourſe. And becauſe his method is no method, but rather a confuſion, I do forbear to reduce the Chapter either to certain Heads or Propoſitions, and will only obſerve ſome few paſſages, to manifeſt that he never underſtood what liberty is. Liberty of ſubjects is not Natural, nor Moral, nor Theologicall, but Political and Civil. In the Civil Law, and Politicks, its oppoſed to ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and bondage, not ſimply and meerly to obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Laws, as he fancieth: for thus he writes.</p>
            <p>T. H.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>— So men have alſo made artificial Charms, called Civil Laws, which they themſelves by mutual Covenants have faſtened at one end to the lips of the Soveraign, at the other to their own ears.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Authors meaning is, That ſo far as Laws bind the ſubject, ſo far they take away his liberty: and men by conſtitution of a Soveraign over them, give a power abſolute to make Laws, and ſo far as they
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170310:35"/>are virtually ſubject to his power, and actually bound by his Laws, they cannot be free; yet this well examined, will not prove true. For not any kind of Obligation takes it away; for then the Laws of Nature, by which a man is bound, before he be ſubject to a civil Soveraign, ſhould deprive him of his liberty, yet they leave him as free a man, as any poſſibly in a free-State can be. The Obligation of juſt Laws and wiſe Edicts do regulate liberty, keep it within its proper bounds, and no waies deſtroy it, or take it away. Therefore that which follows is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable. For he affirms,</p>
            <p>T H.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the liberty of a ſubject therefore lieth only in thoſe things, which in regulating their actions, the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign hath pretermitted.</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>But,
<list>
                  <item>1. In things left indifferent, becauſe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by Law, the ſubject is not only <hi>liber, ſed domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and hath not only <hi>libertatem,</hi> but <hi>poteſtatem.</hi> He is not only free, but Lord of thoſe actions, and hath not only liberty, but alſo an abſolute power.</item>
                  <item>2. Though wiſe and juſt Laws do regulate actions, yet they do not make the agent a ſlave or a ſervant.</item>
               </list>
For to be a ſlave or a ſervant, is to be caſt below the condition of a man, and make him ſubject to ſome thing below himſelf. Wiſdom and Juſtice are above the power of the Soveraign, much more above the liberty of a ſubject. They are particles of the divine
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170310:35"/>perfection, and to be bound by them, is not only a liberty, but an honour. To be free from the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our own baſe luſts and ſins, and the power of Satan, is true liberty divine; and ſo not to be ſubject to the luſts and imperious unworthy commands of abſolute Soveraigns, whoſe wills, though irrational &amp; contrary to juſtice, muſt ſtand for Laws, is civil liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And then a man is Politically free, when he is ſo far Maſter of his life, goods, children, and that which is juſtly his, that they cannot be taken away from him, but for ſome crime contrary to juſt Laws, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving ſuch a penalty. In a word, the liberty of a ſubject is ſuch a ſtate or condition, as that he is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Soveraign power, nor any Laws, bound to do any thing, which a rational and juſt man would not willingly do, though there were no Laws or Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties Civil at all. This is not to be free from Laws. And I do not know, who they are, which he ſaith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands any ſuch thing. The rude and ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and alſo all children of <hi>Belial,</hi> deſire to have a licence, not only to do good, but evil too, as they pleaſe, and they judge all Laws as heavy burdens, and grievous yoaks. If he mean that the ſubjects of <hi>England</hi> demanding the benefit of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the Petition of Right, did aim at any ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant liberty, he muſt needs be a ſlanderer of his own fellow-ſubjects, and an enemy to the Engliſh liberty, as indeed he is, and that through an errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous notion and conceit of abſolute power civil. The liberty of the ſubjects of this Nation is very great, and ſuch, as if we either conſider the Laws of the Conſtitution, or Adminiſtration, the ordinary and common ſubjects of other Nations are but ſlaves
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170310:36"/>unto them. Our Free-holders have the choice of their Knights and Burgeſſes for the Parliament, ſo that neither any Laws can be made, nor moneys im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon them, without their verbal conſent, given by their Repreſentatives. In all cauſes, civil, crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, capital, no Judgement can paſs againſt them but by the verdict of a Jury made up of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, which in it ſelf is an excellent priviledge. The Civilians ſay, <hi>Libertas eſt res ineſtimabilis,</hi> and to be redeemed at any rate; much more the Engliſh liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to be valued, and ever was by our anceſtors, who obtained it, recovered it, kept it, though with the blood of many thouſands. But the queſtion is, whether this liberty is conſiſtent with the Soveraigns power. His opinion is,</p>
            <p>T. H.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That by the liberty of the ſubject, the Soveraigns power of life and death, is neither aboliſhed nor limited.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>G. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Its certain that the Soveraigns power and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects liberty are conſiſtent. For the Soveraign may take away the life of his ſubject, yet according to the evidence of Judgement, agreeable to Law: no otherwiſe. Yet he preſuppoſeth,
<list>
                  <item>1. That the King is ſupreme, and the primary ſubject, owner and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of the original power, which ſometimes may be, yet with us its far otherwiſe.</item>

               <list>
                  <item>1. If he be Gods ſubject, as certainly he is, it follows,
<list>
                        <item>1. That in that reſpect he is but truſted as a ſervant with the Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the power civil.</item>
                        <item>2. That he is fellow-ſubject with his ſubjects.</item>
                        <item>3. He may do injuſtice, as one fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſubject may wrong another.</item>

<list>
                  <item>1. He is not abſolute, or <hi>ſolutus legibus.</hi> His power is limited and bounded by theſe Laws.</item>
                  <item>2. Then he hath no power to murther, oppreſs and deſtroy his innocent ſubjects, who are more Gods then his, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170310:37"/>only truſted by God in his hands for to be protected; righted in all juſt cauſes, and vindicated from all wrongs.</item>
                  <item>3. No Prince or Soveraign can aſſume, or any people give to any perſon or perſons, any the leaſt power above, or contrary unto the Laws of Nature.</item>
               </list>
Theſe Laws are the moral precepts of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal juſtice and equity, from which all civil Laws have their riſe, and are either concluſions drawn from them, or certain rules tending to the better obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. Which things well conſidered, do make it very evident how little the power of civil Lords and Princes muſt needs be. In ſome few indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things, they may be abſolute, have arbitrary power, and be in ſome reſpect above thoſe conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Laws which they themſelves enact.</p>
            <p>His inſtance in <hi>Jephtah</hi> gives them power above, and contrary to the Laws of God and Nature. Yet who will grant him, that <hi>Jephtah</hi> ſacrificed his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170310:37"/>blood. And their ſin was not only becauſe they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to Idols and Devils, but alſo becauſe they ſhed innocent blood, without any warrant or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from God, the only ſupreme and abſolute Lord of life. Further, how could the vow of man, which was but a voluntary Obligation, be above the Law of God, and make that lawful, which by a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Law was unlawful? I verily believe, ſhe was devoted only, not ſacrificed. But ſuppoſe he did ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice her to God, to whom he had vowed her, yet he did not this as a Soveraign of her life, but as a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to God.</p>

            <p>But to make the point more evident, let me digreſs a little, and ſearch out the reaſon and cauſe of the power of life and death, as in the hands of civil Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns. To this end obſerve, That no man hath abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power of his own life, as he hath of his goods: Man may have the uſe and poſſeſsion, but not the propriety and dominion of it. Therefore its granted on all hands, that though a mans life be ſaid to be his own, yet he may not be <hi>felo de ſe,</hi> and kill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; he is not Maſter of his life ſo far, as to have any power or liberty to do any ſuch thing. Its true that God, who is Lord of life and death, gives liberty to man in ſome caſes to hazard, in ſome he commands to lay down his life. He may hazard it in a juſt war and defence of his own Countrey, and alſo of himſelf, againſt an unjuſt invader. He muſt lay down his life, and God commands it for the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Chriſt, in which caſe he that loſeth it ſhall find it. From all this it follows, that no people can by making a Soveraign, give any abſolute power of life and death unto him: For nothing can give that which it hath not: neither can they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170310:38"/>Authors of the unjuſt acts of their Soveraign, much leſs of his murthers, and taking away the lives of their innocent ſubjects. <hi>Id enim quiſque poteſt quod jure poteſt.</hi> If thus it be, then they muſt have power to take away life, from God who alone hath power of life: and this power he only gives in caſe the ſubject be guilty of ſuch crimes as by his Laws are capital.</p>

            <p>By writers, he means the Roman and Greek Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians and Philoſophers, who wrote ſo much of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; amongſt the reſt, eſpecially <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Cicero.</hi> By this, it ſeems he never underſtood theſe Authors, though he accuſe others of ignorance. The liberty which the Engliſh have challenged and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with ſo much expence of blood, is not the power of Kings, much leſs of abſolute Soveraigns, as he would make the world believe, but that which is due unto us by the conſtitution of the State, <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the Laws, and the Petition of Right. Its but the liberty of ſubjects, not Soveraigns, when he hath ſaid all he can; we are not willing to be ſlaves, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject our ſelves to Kings as abſolute Lords. Neither are we willing that either flattering. Divines, Court-Paraſites, or Unjuſt Miniſters of State ſhould wind up the pretended prerogative ſo high, as to ſubject our
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170310:39"/>lives and eſtates, and alſo our Religion to the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, abſolute, and unreaſonable will of one man, whom they did deſire to advance ſo much for their own intereſt. There is a difference between the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects liberty, whereby in many things he may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand himſelf, and ſupreme power which commands others under their Supremacy. By liberty, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> &amp; <hi>Cicero</hi> meant ſuch a priviledge as every ſubject might have in a free-State, not that Soveraignty which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the whole and univerſal body over ſeveral perſons; where it is to be noted, that one and the ſame perſon, who is a ſubject, and at the beſt but a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, hath a ſhare in the Soveraign power. Yet this he hath, not as a ſingle perſon; but as one perſon joyntly with the whole body, or major part at leaſt of the people. So in our Parliaments, every man there is as a ſingle perſon, and all of them any waies conſidered but as the joynt Repreſentative of the people in a certain place, at a certain time, acting according to a certain order, are but ſubjects; yet in the capacity and habitude of a Parliament, they are no ſubjects, but in the name of the people have a Legiſlative power, and exerciſe the higheſt acts of Government, excepting thoſe of the Conſtitution. And this may be one reaſon, why our Engliſh An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors have been ſo careful to maintain and preſerve this great Court and Aſſembly of Parliaments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they knew upon that depended their liberty, in the vacancy and intervals of Parliaments. For take away this, and our liberty is gone. And wiſe men know, that the liberty of the Engliſh ſubject de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon theſe great Aſſemblies. Some therefore have attempted, either the total extirpation of them,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170310:39"/>according to the example of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> or a diminution of their power and priviledges, ſo as to make them meer ſhadows. If any ſay, and infer from all this, that therefore the form of our Government even under Kings is popular, and hath the nature of a free-State. I ſay, it hath much of a free-State in the Conſtitution, but not in the Adminiſtration. Yet its far different from thoſe four kinds of popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments mentioned by <hi>Ariſtotle, Pol. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 4. The conſtitution whereof is little better then level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. The principal thing aimed at in ſuch forms, as the Author alledgeth out of the Philoſopher, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Ejuſdem libri,</hi> was liberty, ſuppoſing it could be had no where but in ſuch Governments: and this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was to do either what they pleaſed, or to govern by courſe, fearing leſt any perſon or perſons conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued long in any eminent place of command, would in time ingroſs the power. Yet this ſuppoſition was falſe. For liberty might be had without levelling, and free-States might be, and have been better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and regulated. For no conſtitution is good, where proviſion is not made, that Wiſdom and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, rather then perſons may govern: and the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude ſo kept under, as that they may be ſubjects, not rebels, and caſt off all power. To return unto the matter propoſed, and conclude this point.

            <p>This is the ſubſtance of three pages, and amounts to ſo much as may eaſily be compriſed in a few words. For when a ſubject is not bound either by the Laws of the Conſtitution or Adminiſtration, he is free according to Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his judgement. Yet in proper ſenſe in both theſe caſes, he is no ſubject; but <hi>[Dominus]</hi> and far more then <hi>[liber].</hi> The Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians do better determine the liberty of the ſubject to be <hi>[poteſtatem agendi ſub publicae defenſionis prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidio]</hi> though this be no perfect definition. As before, ſo now I ſay, that liberty here is not oppoſed to obligation but ſervitude. For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o be ſubject to a wiſe Soveraign according to juſt Laws, is ſo much liberty as any reaſonable man can deſire: for in this reſpect he is rather ſubject to God then man; and to ſerve him is doubtleſs perfect freedom. As no Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170310:40"/>ſhould be denyed ſo much power as to protect the leaſt, if innocent, and to puniſh the greateſt, if guilty; ſo no ſubject ſhould be bound to do evil, which is ſervitude and bondage indeed, or reſtrained from doing that good which God commands him. Civil government was never ordained by God, to be deſtructive either of moral or divine vertues, or of the noble condition of man as a rational creature. Therefore regular ſubmiſſion unto ſupreme power, will never ſtand with any obligation unto evil, or contract for protection except in innocency. <hi>Paul</hi> pleading before <hi>Feſtus</hi> ſaith, If I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuſe not to die, <hi>Acts</hi> 25.11. How this can ſtand with what this Author ſaith, when he affirmeth that its lawful for a man guilty and condemned to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf if he can, I leave to others for to examine. From the Apoſtles words its evident, he deſires no protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even of himſelf, as worthy of death, neither hath God given any power to man to ſave in ſuch a caſe. And though any perſon by the Law of nature may defend himſelf, yet this muſt be done <hi>cum mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramine tutelae inculpatae.</hi> In caſe a ſubject hath made himſelf capitally guilty, he hath forfeited his life to his Soveraign as Gods Vicegerent, whom he muſt not reſiſt in the execution of Juſtice, though he be not bound to kill himſelf: neither doth the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or ſtrength of any ſuch capital offenders, any waies give them right to reſiſt their Soveraign in their, own defence, as the Author would have it. For they cannot defend themſelves as men, but they muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves in this caſe as guilty men, which is not lawful. How the offer of pardon ſhould take
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170310:41"/>away the plea of ſelf-defence, I underſtand not, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had no right before it was offered. The offer of pardon indeed, if the party offering may be ſafely truſted, may take away all fear, and ſo all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of any plea by force to defend themſelves from that death, which pardon will take away or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move.</p>
            <p>In the cloſe of this diſcourſe concerning liberty of the ſubject, he grants it a part of this liberty, That the ſubject may ſue his Soveraign, and before a Judge appointed by the ſaid Soveraign. If this be ſo, then
<list>
                  <item>1. The ſubject hath propriety of goods.</item>
                  <item>2. That he and his Soveraign are two diſtinct parties, and in this caſe the Soveraign repreſents him not as one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</item>
                  <item>3. That the Law in this reſpect is above the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governor.</item>
                  <item>4. Therefore the Soveraign is not abſolute.</item>
                  <item>5. That the ſubject may complain of ſome actions and injuſtice of the Soveraign, contrary to the Authors fourth right of Soveraigns.</item>
                  <item>6. That to him belongs not all Judicature, in all Cauſes, as in the eighth, right of majeſty he did affirm.</item>
               </list>
Yet he diſtinguiſheth of the Soveraigns demand as twofold, either by vertue of a Law, or by force; if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or take away any thing by power or pretence thereof, there lyeth in that caſe no action of Law, becauſe the ſubject is made Author of the Soveraigns acts, and therefore the ſuit againſt him, is againſt the Plantiff himſelf, being his ſubject. If this anſwer be good, then the Soveraign may do what he can and will, not what he ought; he may rule according to his ſtrength and power, and not according to Juſtice: he may borrow, and promiſe to repay; take away, and engage to reſtore, and yet do no ſuch thing, but
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170310:41"/>violate his promiſe and engagement, contrary to the very Law of Nature. He hath a liberty to be unjuſt and wicked, and that more then any of his ſubjects, as he hath greater power. I leave him to be a ſubject of ſuch a Soveraign, and wiſh all good men a better. The true reaſon, why a Soveraign may be ſued, is, 1. Becauſe in the inſtitution of a Soveraign, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of adminiſtration, the ſubjects may reſerve the propriety of their goods, which may be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diminution of a lawful ſupreme power; and in this caſe, when a Soveraign takes away or detains that which is his ſubjects, and an action is brought againſt him, the ſubject is not his ſubject, nor he his Soveraign in that reſpect. Both of them in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular are but private perſons; and he that is ſubject to him as he is juſt in his Government, queſtions him as he is unjuſt in his actions. Again, propriety belongs unto the Law of nature, which is above civil power. But he proceeds.</p>
            <p>T. H.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If a Monarch, or Soveraign Aſſembly, grant a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to all or any of his ſubjects, which grant ſtanding, he is diſabled to provide for their ſafety, the grant is void, unleſs he directly renounce or transfer his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty to another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this we eaſily underſtand to what purpoſe the Treaty in the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> with the King was. For though the Parliament had voted his conceſſions to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170310:42"/>be ſatisfactory, in ſome reſpect that of Biſhops, and he was ready to cloſe with them, yet in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this man, and all that party adhering to the King, the Parliament was accounted no Parliament, the King an abſolute Monarch, and the Conceſſions, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> void: and for this reaſon, becauſe the King had diſabled himſelf by granting the Militia to protect his ſubjects. And the iſſue of this Treaty to be expected was this, ſo far as the King had obtained liberty and opportunity, he would declare his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions void and unreaſonable, and ſo poſſeſs himſelf of the Militia, and proceed againſt the Treators, as Rebels and Enemies; for ſo they were account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Yet this was not a meer grant of liberty, but of power, which in the Treaty is preſuppoſed to be his, though confined and a priſoner, and vanquiſhed in a civil war. But if we will ſpeak properly, the grant of liberty may be ſuch as it may amount to an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption</hi> from a ſufficient degree of ſubjection, but it doth not transfer the Soveraign power to another; And this muſt needs be granted, that to paſs away any of the greater rights, is to dethrone. In the concluſion of this <hi>Cap.</hi> we are informed when the obligation of the ſubject to the Soveraign doth ceaſe; and it is then when his power to protect doth ceaſe. And there is great reaſon for it. For whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his title may be, and how unjuſtly ſoever it may be taken away, and howſoever his ſubjects may ſtand well affected towards him, yet ſeeing there can be no protection from wrong within, nor from inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of enemies without, nor adminiſtration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, without which any people returns unto the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170310:42"/>confuſion of Anarchy, except there be actual poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of power; therefore Obligation for the preſent muſt ceaſe, or at leaſt be ſuſpended. There be many waies, whereby a Soveraign may ceaſe to be a Soveraign, as by conqueſt, death, reſignation, ceſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when the Soveraign ceaſeth to be ſuch, the Obligation muſt needs determine, as to ſuch a particular Governor. And here I might take occaſion to treat of ſubalternate Governments, and fiduciary Princes, who are Soveraigns in reſpect of their ſubjects, yet acknowledge a ſuperiour, from whom they hold their territory. But ſeeing he is ſilent, I will be ſo too.</p>

            <p>I Paſs by his diviſions and ſubdiviſions of Syſtems, as being well known to ſuch as are acquainted either with Politicks, or Civil Law. For the ſubject of <hi>Juriſprudentia civilis,</hi> being <hi>communio,</hi> or <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas hominum;</hi> wherein the Lawyers out of their inſtitutions obſerve perſons, things and actions both private and publick, that they may the better find out the ſeveral rights determined by Law: They diſtinguiſh <hi>perſonam in ſingularem &amp; conjunctam. Perſona conjuncta,</hi> conſiſts of ſeveral perſons diſtinct Phyſically, yet made one by conſent and aſſociation Politically. And theſe Syſtems and Societies may be conſidered as parts of the Community, which is the immediate ſubject of a Common-wealth, and a civil Government. Some of theſe are natural, as a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſome are voluntary and by inſtitution. In a Common-wealth once conſtituted, all theſe are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the ſupreme power, and their actions are ſo far warrantable, as they derive their power from the Soveraign, and are agreeable to the Laws.</p>
            <p>Some of theſe are made by diviſion, co-ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſubordination, as Provinces, Counties, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, Allotments, Town-ſhips, Pariſhes. Some of them are Eccleſiaſtical, ſome Civil. Some are made by Charter and Patent, and have their ſpecial privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170310:43"/>and immunnities, and have their Statutes, and power to make Orders and By-Laws within themſelves, and ſome have juriſdiction within their liberties. Some are more noble, as Colledges, and Univerſities, and Schools, and all ſuch as are Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of Law and Learning; ſome leſs noble, as Corporations, with their ſeveral Companies and Officers.</p>
            <p>The end of the inſtitution of theſe, is either for the better and more eaſie Government of the whole Community: or for the better education of the ſubjects in learning or trades; or for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or enriching, or adorning of the State.</p>
            <p>And it concerns the ſupreme Governors of a State, to have a ſpecial care of theſe Societies, to order, regulate and reform them, as they ſhall ſee occaſion or need. For the good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth doth much depend upon the regulation and wiſe ordering of them.</p>

               </list>
This latter is my work in this part of his Book, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in other paſſages of his diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The ſubject of this Chapter is <hi>[The Miniſters of State]</hi> which by ſome in Latine are called <hi>[Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ales]</hi> in Engliſh, Officers; and by the ſame generally is underſtood the ſame with theſe, who are ſtiled, and that very fitly [Publick Miniſters of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Power.] For in all acts of civil Government, the principal agent is the Soveraign, the inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal or miniſterial are Officers, who are therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by ſome, <hi>inſtrumenta majeſtatis vicaria,</hi> which words imply much, and contain in ſome ſort the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of the Author. For they imply,
<list>
                  <item>1. That the Soveraign is the principal agent.</item>
                  <item>2. That they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Soveraign.</item>
                  <item>3. That they are but his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and act by power derived from him.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The difference between them and the Soveraign is,
<list>
                  <item>1. That they are eſſentially and properly but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and accidentally Officers.</item>
                  <item>2. That though they have power, and the ſame is the Soveraigns, yet as in him its original, ſupreme, univerſal in reſpect of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170310:44"/>the whole ſtate, in them it is derivative, ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, particular, or but a part and particle of it.</item>
                  <item>3. That whatſoever the Soveraign acts, is valid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in it ſelf; but what they act is only good and valid as they are one perſon with him, and make his will their rule and principle, and do all things in his name.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon why there muſt be Officers in every State, and that of neceſſity, is given, becauſe no So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, whether one perſon or more, can ſee all things with his own eyes, hear all things with his own ears, do all things with his own hands, or be preſent and acting in every place, where he ought to act. This is proper to God, who yet uſeth the Miniſtry both of men and Angels, in the Government of the world, but not out of any neceſſity, but becauſe its his will and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>There be two parts of Politicks;
<list>
                  <item>the 1. Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which diſpoſeth the ſupreme power in a certain ſubject, whether one or more; and determines the rights both of the Soveraign and ſubject.</item>
                  <item>The 2. Adminiſtration, which is the exerciſe of that power.</item>
               </list>
In which Adminiſtration, the firſt act is <hi>legiſlation;</hi> and this is the proper place to ſpeak of Laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Adminiſtration, as different from thoſe of the Conſtitution; the next is the making of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers for the execution of theſe Laws. This is the method, and here is the proper handling of this ſubject.</p>
            <p>Theſe Officers are either extraordinary or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; Extraordinary, are ſuch as are truſted with power for a time limited in ſome extraordinary exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of the State, as the Dictators amongſt the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170310:45"/>
               <hi>Romans.</hi> Ordinary, are ſuch as are uſual in all States; and they are either ſuch as by which the Soveraign acts and deals with forrein States, or within his own Dominions. The former are Embaſſadors, Agents, Meſſengers, Heralds, Intelligencers. Theſe Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors are conſtant and <hi>legier,</hi> or temporary &amp; occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. They repreſent Majeſty, and act according to the Laws of Nations. The Officers within the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns Dominions, are either for war or peace. For war either by Sea or Land: hence <hi>Jus Nauticum &amp; Militare;</hi> and theſe are for defence, and act alſo according to the Laws of Nations. For peace, and they are either for counſel, or judgement, or execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the revenue. Hence Councellers, Judges, Sheriffs, Treaſurers, and all their ſervants or ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Agents and Aſſiſtants. Amongſt theſe there is a ſubordination, till we come to ſome general Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, in every ſeveral kind next unto the Soveraign. How to reduce the Officers of this or any other State unto theſe heads, is not my work; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have made this reduction in ſeveral Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths.</p>
            <p>The general rules of theſe Officers are many, and may be read in ſeveral Authors: As
<list>
                  <item>1. Any man fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualified may be forced to do ſervice for his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</item>
                  <item>2. To avoid confuſion and charge, they are to be reduced to a certain number and order. The number ſhould be according to the neceſſity of the State.</item>
                  <item>3. No Officer ſhould be truſted too long with great and tranſcendent power.</item>
                  <item>4. They ſhould be fitly qualified and advanced for deſert, and no other reaſon.</item>
                  <item>5. Some ſhould be ſuperintendents over others within a certain precinct, and alſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170310:45"/>viſitors ſelected of purpoſe, to enquire into the carriage of all the reſt at certain ſet times.</item>
               </list>
The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Cenſors had ſome power in this kind, but no Juriſdiction: As the Viſitors of <hi>China</hi> are ſaid to have.</p>
            <p>In this Chapter Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> ſeems to make Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel, ſuch as the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. calls Paſtors and Teachers, to be publick Miniſters and Officers civil; yet though they be ſubject to the civil Soveraign as well as other men, yet as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters they derive their power from Chriſt by the Church, and not from any civil Governors, as ſhall be made good hereafter.</p>

               <hi>Propriety in all kinds of Common-wealths belongs to the Soveraign power. And again, propriety is the act only of the Soveraign, who diſtributes to every man his own by Law; and this diſtribution is firſt of Land, as of the Land of Promiſe by</hi> Eleazer <hi>and</hi> Joſhua, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <item>2. The Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of any Common-wealth doth preſuppoſe this propriety, without which there can be no buying, ſelling, exchanging, ſtealing, reſtitution; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the eighth Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal,</hi>

                  <item>3. All that may be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this point, is, That the Soveraign may preſerve and regulate propriety, both by Laws and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Yet the Author makes all men brutes, nay wild and ravenous beaſts, and birds of prey, until they have made themſelves ſlaves unto ſome abſolute Soveraign, and ſuch they muſt be, either beaſts by the Law of nature, or ſlaves by the Laws of a civil State.</item>

The propriety of that Land was at the firſt, and continued in God; for they were but Gods Tenants, in a ſpecial and peculiar manner, ſo as no people in the world was; therefore no man could alienate nor morgage beyond the year of Jubilee: at which time God ſeemed to renue their Leaſes, after the Jubilee-Sabbath.</item>

                  <item>1. The Soveraign is bound to obſerve the Laws of nature, which are the moral Laws of God; and propriety as by the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Imperium nihil aliud eſſe ſapientes definiunt, niſi curam ſalutis alienae,</hi> ſaith one very well. For civil ſupreme power was never given by any people to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their propriety, but to defend it. Otherwiſe no intelligent people in the world would advance one perſon or more to take away their goods, and ſo put themſelves in a worſe condition then they were by the Laws of nature.</item>
                  <item>3. It may be granted, that the Soveraign hath <hi>dominium eminens,</hi> ſo far as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand not only the eſtates, but the lives of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for the publike ſafety; but what is this to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety properly taken?</item>
                  <item>4. If his aſſertion were true, then that diſtinction of Civilians, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of Politicks, whereby they put a difference <hi>inter res &amp; poſſeſſiones publicas</hi> and <hi>privatas,</hi> were in vain and falſe; but ſo it is not.</item>
                  <item>5. By the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns in <hi>England,</hi> he means the Kings, who were
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170310:47"/>no Soveraigns at all, nor could at any time raiſe any moneys, or impoſe any ſubſidy upon the people with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their conſent in Parliament, as not only Engliſh men, but forrein Miniſters of State, who have either read our Hiſtories, or our Laws, or our practice, do well know, and have made it known to others.</item>
                  <item>6. There may be a device in Law, to paſs all the land in <hi>England</hi> upon the Crown, for to derive all tenures from thence, or to confirm propriety to the ſubjects, for that every one might not only know, but keep and recover his own the better: Yet this gives the King no more propriety, then a <hi>Peoffee</hi> in truſt may have; and that is none.</item>

            </p>
            <p>His meaning is, that the Soveraign cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a certain revenue, as ſufficient to defray the publick charge. Yet the wiſeſt States in the world have certainly defined a conſtant ſtanding revenue for the publick uſe. For we read of the Dominion of <hi>France,</hi> which though the Kings could neither alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, nor juſtly impare, yet <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth hath wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully mangled, and given occaſion of thoſe heavy op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the people of that State; and alſo we are not ignorant of the Crown lands, and revenue of <hi>England.</hi> And this is but agreeable to Scripture, where we read that God commanded, in the diviſion
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170310:48"/>of the holy Land, that the Prince ſhould have his portion, that he may no more oppreſs, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 45.7, 8. For the Land muſt be divided into three parts; The firſt muſt be for God to maintain the Prieſts and Levites: The ſecond for the Prince, the third for the people: and thus ſome ſay the Land in <hi>England</hi> was divided in the time of the pious <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings. Yet it muſt be confeſſed, that ſometimes the publick charge may be ſo great, as that a ſtanding revenue cannot defray it, and then the ſubjects for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good and ſafety, are bound and may be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to contribute. But if this in a time of peace and ſafety be embezelled and miſpent by a prodigal Prince, and his favourites and followers, this will no waies warrant him to fly upon the ſpoyl, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſubjects. What <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror here in <hi>England</hi> did, it matters not much. For if he did derive his title from <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, as ſome Hiſtories ſay he did pretend, then he was no Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign. If he did act as Conquerer, then all compact and right upon Covenant is void, as his ſucceſſors, who inſiſt upon that title of conqueſt, give full liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Engliſh to fight againſt them, and depoſe them if they can, and deal with them as enemies.</p>
            <p>As for making Laws for the regulation of Traffick, Trade, Exchange, the value, ſtamp and coining of moneys, the ſending out of Colonies for new Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as alſo to make them as Provinces, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt them from ſubjection, becauſe they will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low protection, I grant all theſe are prerogatives of the Soveraign.</p>

                  <item>2. The difference between counſel and command, made evident out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The difference between counſel, command, exhortation, dehortation, is eaſily known. For Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel given, is a declaration of the means which tend unto ſome certain end, and alſo of the order and manner how they ſhould be uſed to attain that end. Command is the will of a Superiour made known, whereby the inferiour is bound to obey, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to ſuffer. Exhortation preſſeth the practiſe of ſome good to be done; as dehortation is the contrary. Counſel directs, command binds, exhortation endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſtir up or incite the will: dehortation keeps it back. Command is of a Superiour; Counſel, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, dehortation are of a ſuperiour, inferiour, equal. For any of theſe may counſel, exhort, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170310:49"/>as any of them may be counſelled, exhorted, dehorted. Its true, that theſe words are not alwaies taken ſtrictly.</p>
            <p>That command ſhould be for the benefit of the party commanding, and counſel for the good of the party counſelled, is meerly accidental in waies eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to them. And though ſometimes both the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the event of both may be ſuch as he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, yet we know it is many times otherwiſe. For command may ſometimes, nay often, be beneficial to the party commanded, and intended to be ſo; as counſel may be intended, not only for the good of the party counſelled, but alſo counſelling; and alſo prove ſo to be. The nature of exhortation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, is as falſly, looſely and impertinently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, as the former.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Upon the former ſuppoſed difference between counſel and command, he determines, <hi>Thou ſhalt have none other Gods; Thou ſhalt not make any graven image,</hi> &amp;c. to be commands. Yet theſe are not for the benefit of God, but man keeping them. For in keeping them there is great reward. But, <hi>Go and ſell all thou haſt,</hi> &amp;c. is only a counſel with him, becauſe the party ſhall have benefit, even treaſure in heaven if he do ſo. Yet even this is ſo a counſel, as it is a command. For man is bound to love God more then the world; and to preferr treaſure in heaven, before treaſure on earth, and this by command. As it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects, its counſel; as it binds, its command.</p>
            <p>For one and the ſame ſentence may be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, a counſel and an exhortation too, yet in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent reſpects; as it binds a command, as it directs a counſel, as it incites an exhortation. And very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170310:49"/>exhortations include, or at leaſt preſuppoſe a command, and a counſel. But I wonder why Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> ſhould make theſe words of <hi>Peter, Repent and be baptized, Acts</hi> 2.38. a counſel only. Are not all men, eſpecially which hear the Goſpel, bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent? For doth not Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>And the time of this ignorance God winked at, but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent, Acts</hi> 17.30 And what will he contradict the Apoſtle, and in expreſs terms? It ſeems he is but a Divine of the loweſt rank, as he is a States-man far under the higheſt form. His preſumption and boldneſs is very great, but his knowledge and judgement very defective: For if he had known, that repentance had been a principal duty, according to a principal command of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and that it was nothing elſe but a return to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, after diſobedience, he might have corrected himſelf, and avoided this errour.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the next place, he undertakes to determine the qualifications of a good Counſellor of State; which hath been done to his hand, and far better then here we read. He is a good Counſellor, who gives good connſel; and that is only good counſel, which is a greeable to the wiſdom and juſtice of God, and tends to the publick good of the State, therefore his firſt Condition is either imperfect, or elſe directly falſe. For the intereſt and ends of the Counſellor in his counſel, to be conſiſtent with the ends and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of a Prince counſelled, is no waies abſolutely good, but may be very wicked and unjuſt.</p>
            <p>The reſt of the conditions preſcribed by him are good, yet none of the chiefeſt mentioned by others, omitted by him.</p>
            <pb n="90" facs="tcp:170310:50"/>
            <p n="4">4. In the laſt part of this Chapter he endeavours to prove, but yet upon very weak, and alſo very falſe grounds, That its better to hear Counſellors apart, then in an Aſſembly. What he means by theſe words prefixed [ſuppoſing the number of them equal] I know not. For he argues againſt counſel given in Aſſemblies, without any mention of the equality of their number. Yet this is evident by this rule of God, that the privy Council and Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> are made uſeleſs, unprofitable, at leaſt not ſo good as a ſecret pact Juncto. This is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and baſe, and hath been the ruine of many Princes. The Conſtitution of <hi>England</hi> required a Parliament, as the great Council of the Kingdom, <hi>in arduis regni negotiis;</hi> and a ſtanding Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel (as it was called) in other matters of leſſer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That both theſe may be ill conſtituted, abuſed and turned into factions, there is no doubt, we have had too woful experience of this. Yet all theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, with others mentioned by the Author, may be prevented, and the Counſels rectified. The way to our good, and the welfare of <hi>England,</hi> is not to take them away and deſtroy them, but reduce them, if poſſibly it may be done, to their prime inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. Otherwiſe we may fear a military Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or an abſolute Monarch, or a Tyrannie, or an Anarchy. A wiſe council of Lords ſtanding, and the great Council of the Parliament have been the beſt ſupports under God, of the peace and happineſs of this Nation. In this I am brief, becauſe here is little that is material, and it more properly belongs to that head of Miniſters of State and Officers.</p>

Therefore the proper place of treating con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Laws civil in general, is in the firſt part of adminiſtration, which requires firſt that Laws be made. For God himſelf did avouch himſelf to be <hi>Iſraels</hi> Lord and King, and they avouch themſelves his ſubjects and people, and this was the conſtitution of that State. This being done, in the next place he proceedeth to make Laws. And this is the order of all ſuch as will imitate God, and proceed orderly to govern a State, as appears, <hi>Exodus</hi> 19. and the 20. Chapters, and ſo forward. This alſo was <hi>Jethroes</hi> counſel unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> and approved of God. Thou ſhalt teach them Ordinances and Laws, and ſhalt ſhew them the way wherein they muſt walk, and the

This was making of Officers, after he had given them Laws, and let them Judge the people. This is juriſdiction, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.20, 21, 22.

The difference between Laws Civil in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the Civil Law of the Roman Empire, is more eaſily known, and learned from the Civilians, who have clearly delivered it, then from him. For Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks ſpeaks of Civil or Political Laws (made for the Government of State) more generally; and if it mention any Laws of particular States, they are but examples to the general rules concerning Laws. But let us paſs by this, and proceed to his definition, which is as followeth.</p>
            <p>T H.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Civil Law is to every ſubject, thoſe rules which the Common-wealth hath commanded him by word, writing, or other ſufficient ſign of the will to make uſe of it, for the diſtinction of right and wrong, that is, of what is contrary, and what is not contrary to the rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this definition, the <hi>Genus</hi> is, its a rule; the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe is the Common-wealth; the party bound is the ſubject; the end is the diſtinction of wrong which is contrary, and right which is not
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170310:51"/>contrary to the rule. But
<list>
                  <item>1. The <hi>Genus</hi> is not a rule, which is an act of the underſtanding; whereas Law is not only an act of the underſtanding, but the will, which is <hi>facultas imperans.</hi> Many may give rules by their wiſdom, which can make no Laws by their wills.</item>
                  <item>2. The efficient cauſe is not the Common-wealth, but <hi>pars imperans,</hi> the Soveraign who is but one part of it.</item>
                  <item>3. The end is not only to declare a diſtinction between right and wrong, but to bind the ſubject to do that which is right, and to forbear that which is wrong. For <hi>lex eſt regula obligativa.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. Not content to give the definition, he explains what is right, and that is that which is not contrary to the Law; and wrong, and its that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. But what he means by <hi>rule</hi> is hard to know.</item>
               </list>
If he mean by rule, Law it ſelf, then its abſurd; if he intends ſome antecedent rule of divine wiſdom, manifeſting what is juſt or unjuſt, before a civil pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er command it, he is obſcure. Though he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value the Philoſopher ſo much, as far below him, though he was far above him, he might with <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulis</hi> of <hi>Padua,</hi> in his <hi>Defenſor Pacis, pars</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. have obſerved out of him a better definition of a Law given, <hi>Ethn. ad Nicho. lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. <hi>Lex eſt ſententia, doctrina ſeu judicium univerſale juſtorum &amp; conferentium civilium &amp; ſuorum oppoſitorum cum praecepto coactivo per poenam aut praemium de ejus obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatione in hoc ſaeculo deſtribuenda.</hi> More briefly, its a coactive precept of the Soveraign binding the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to obedience, and upon the ſame to be rewarded, or upon diſobedience to be puniſhed in this life; where many things are to be obſerved.

This hath far more of the definition of a Law then his, and more fully declares the nature of a Law civil. Yet if either he, or any other will improve it, I ſhall like it well, for I know mine own imperfections. From his definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he infers ſeveral concluſions, the firſt whereof is.</p>
            <p>T. H.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Legiſlator in all Common-wealths is the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign: Again, the Common-wealth is the Legiſlator by the Repreſentative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>pars imperans,</hi> is the Legiſlator in every State, muſt needs be granted: but that the Common-wealth ſhould be the Legiſlator, either by or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>(pars imperans)</hi> the Soveraign, I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. For it conſiſts of two parts, the Soveraign and the ſubject; and if the whole Common-wealth make Laws, then the ſubject as well as the Soveraign is Legiſlator. In a Republick or free-State, there is a difference between the Soveraign and the ſubject, much more in other models and forms. Therefore he muſt needs ſpeak either improperly or untruly, when he ſaith the State is Legiſlator.</p>
            <pb n="96" facs="tcp:170310:53"/>
            <p>T. H.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concluſion</hi> 2. <hi>The Soveraign is not ſubject to the civil Laws, becauſe he hath power to make and repeal them at pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Soveraign in divers reſpects, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a Soveraign, is not ſubject unto, but above the Laws, is a certain truth. For Laws do bind the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, not the Soveraign, to obey or be puniſhed; but the Soveraign doth command as Superiour, not obey as inferiour; doth puniſh, is not puniſhed. The power to make a Law, when there is none, and to repeal after that its made, is ſufficient evidence of his ſuperiority, as alſo diſpenſations in judgement and pardons be. Yet this ſupreme will Legiſlative over men, is ſubject to the ſuperiour will of God, and muſt neither make, nor repeal Laws, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to wiſdom and juſtice.</p>
            <p>T. H.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concluſion</hi> 3. <hi>Cuſtom is not Law by long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of time, but by conſent of the Soveraign.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="97" facs="tcp:170310:53"/>
            <p>
               <hi>G. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This follows from the firſt Concluſion. For if the Soveraign only be the Legiſlator, then continuance of time and practiſe of the people, though univerſal, cannot make a Law. The Soveraign muſt give either an expreſs, or tacit conſent; and this conſent is then moſt evident, when he makes the cuſtom a rule in judgement, and obſerves it. And the Civilians well obſerve, that beſides con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of time, and the Soveraigns conſent, A third thing is required, and that is, that the beginning of it be reaſonable, as the Author here doth note.</p>
            <p>T. H.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concluſion</hi> 4. <hi>The Law of Nature, and the Civil Law, contain each other, and are of equal extent. For the Laws of Nature, which conſiſt in equity, juſtice, gratitude and other moral vertues on theſe depending, in the condition of meer nature, are not properly laws, but qualities, that diſpoſe men to peace and obedience; when a Common-wealth is once actually ſettled, then are they Laws,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <item>1. This is no Concluſion from the definition, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he mean that the rule of right and wrong be the Law of Nature.</item>
               <item>2. The Laws of Nature are the Laws of God, and not of man; and not only ſubjects,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170310:54"/>but Soveraigns are bound by them.</item>
               <item>3. Therefore they bind not as commanded by the civil Soveraign, but as written by the hand of heaven in the heart of man. Neither is that which afterwards he makes the difference between the Law of Nature, and the Law of civil Governors, any difference at all, that the one is written, the other not. For both are written, one by the hand of man, though every Civil Law be not written, and the other by the hand of God: the one in the heart, the other upon ſome other material ſubſtance; and that which is written in the heart, may be written out of it.</item>
               <item>4. Equity, juſtice grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and other moral vertues, are not Laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but either habitual or actual conformities unto the Laws of Nature.</item>
               <item>5. How the Laws of Nature, and Laws Civil ſhould be of equal extent, and yet contain one another, and be parts one of another, I do not underſtand.</item>
               <item>6. A Law of Nature is only then a civil Law, when its declared to be ſo by the civil Soveraign, yet its a Law before.</item>
               <item>7. For the moſt part learned men do underſtand by the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, certain divine principles imprinted upon the heart of man; by the Laws of Nations, more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate; by the Laws civil, more remote Concluſions of conſtitutive Laws civil.</item>

            <p>T. H.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seeing all Laws have their authority and force from the will of the Soveraign, a man may wonder whence proceed ſuch opinions as are found in the Books of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers of eminence in ſeveral Common-wealths, directly or by conſequence, making the Legiſlative power depend on
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170310:54"/>private men, or ſubordinate Judges: as for example, That the Common-Law hath no Controuler but the Parliament.</hi> Item, <hi>That the Common-Law hath two arms, Force and Juſtice, the one whereof is in the King, the other depoſited in the hands of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The former Concluſion, which is the fifth in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, That the Laws of Princes and Countries ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, depend upon the Soveraign conquering is true. And it is wiſdom in the Conquerors to grant them the Laws and Cuſtoms of God, and no waies prejudicial to their power. For many are willing to change their Governors, yet unwilling to change their Government. But as concerning the two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes of Law, I might refer him to the Learned in that profeſſion, who no doubt can make them good againſt any thing he hath ſaid. They ſeem to him to be unreaſonable, partly becauſe he is ignorant of the Conſtitution, both of this, and alſo of other States; partly becauſe they are inconſiſtent with his Utopian principles. For he preſuppoſeth,
<list>
                  <item>1. That the King of <hi>England</hi> is an abſolute Monarch.</item>
                  <item>2. That the Parliament, as a Parliament, is meerly a ſubject.</item>
                  <item>3. That the King hath power at will and pleaſure to call Parliaments, and diſſolve them; yet theſe hath he not made good, neither can he. 1. That our Kings are not abſolute Monarchs is well known, the Laws and practice have made it manifeſt. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ignorant perſons and paraſites may ſay, yet wiſe men, both Engliſh and Forreign States-men, who
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170310:55"/>have dealt with <hi>England,</hi> have been aſſured of the contrary; eſpecially when in certain leagues they have required the conſent of the Parliament.</item>
               </list>
Again, the Kings of <hi>England</hi> never made or repealed a Law, nor levied a ſubſidie alone themſelves, without a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. And they are ſworn <hi>[corroborare leges, quas vulgus elegerit]</hi> For let <hi>[Elegerit]</hi> be what tenſe it will, <hi>vulgus,</hi> which is <hi>populus, non rex, eligit leges;</hi> and the late King in his anſwer to the 19. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, did confeſs that the Lords and Commons had a ſhare in the Legiſlative power. And it were very much to be wondered at, if that King, who himſelf alone could never make or repeal a Law, nor levy or impoſe a ſubſidie, nor revoke the judgement of any Court, nor alter a word or clauſe in any Law agreed upon in Parliament, ſhould be an abſolute Monarch. Its far more probable he was only truſted with the force for the execution of juſtice, according to Law and Judgement, according to the ſecond maxime. And if he was no abſolute Soveraign, then his ſecond ſuppoſition, that the Parliament, as ſuch, is only an Aſſembly of private men and ſubjects, and to be conſidered in no other capacity, is falſe: As likewiſe his third, That the King can call and diſſolve Parliaments at will and pleaſure. For by the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, the Laws and practiſe, he was bound to call them once a year, and oftner as the neceſſity and exigency of affairs either of peace or war ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. And in ſuch caſes to diſſolve them before the <hi>[ardua Regni]</hi> were diſpatched, was both dangerous and deſtructive; and did argue either a bad conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or a corruption of the ſame.</p>

               <hi>Law cannot be againſt reaſon, neither is it the letter, but the intention of the Law-giver that is the Law. And this reaſon is not private of ſubordinate Judges, but of the ſupreme Lawgiver.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>G. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this is willingly granted, if he underſtand by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, not the meer conceit or will of the Soveraign, but that reaſon which is a ray of divine wiſdom ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mind of the Law-giver, regulating his judgement, and expreſſed in the words of the Law. And the ſenſe of a Law given by a learned Judge ſubordinate, may be very true, yet not authentick: becauſe he that makes the Law, can interpret Law in that manner, and none elſe. I paſs by his diſcourſe concerning promulgation and interpretation of Law, as alſo the qualification of Judges, which belongs to that Chapter of Officers formerly mentioned. He might have done well to have improved theſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. Treatiſes of other learned Authors, who have informed us both more accurately, and alſo more particularly of theſe things, then he himſelf hath done. But he conceits himſelf as far above them, as they ſurpaſs ordinary men. Neither is his diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Laws worth the examination, as being very crude and indigeſted, as alſo heterogeneous.

For God formerly ſpake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fathers by the Prophets, in the latter times to their children by his Son firſt, and after by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. The queſtion here is not how we ſhall attain a demonſtrative, clear, or intuitive knowledge of the matter of the Law, nor of the manner of the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; but how we may be aſſured that the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or teſtimony of him to whom the revelation was made, is divine, that we may believe it as divine and from God. The means whereby the divinity of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170310:56"/>the teſtimony was made evident at the firſt, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, as ſigns, wonders, and divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, according to his own will, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4. But after that upon theſe divine at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations the Goſpel was generally received in all Nations, and the propheſies of the Old Teſtament in this particular fulfilled, theſe ceaſed; yet one thing alwaies did, and ever will manifeſt the teſtimony and doctrine of the Goſpel to be divine, and that is the Holy-Ghoſt, who (by his powerful working upon the hearts of men, ſeriouſly attending to this truth, whereby a great change both inwardly in their hearts, and outwardly in their lives is wrought) doth mightily confirm it. And thoſe who find, and feel in themſelves the effects of ſanctification and heavenly comfort, can no waies doubt, but are aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that God was in the Prophets and Apoſtles, and did ſpeak by them. Beſides when we conſider,
<list>
                  <item>1. That the more we underſtand them, the more excellency of wiſdom we find in them.</item>
                  <item>2. That theſe poſitives are agreeable and no waies contrary to pure morals.</item>
                  <item>3. That they conduce effectually to holineſs and eternal life.</item>
                  <item>4. That they were appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, received by the beſt men in the world, and ſealed with the blood of many Martyrs, we muſt needs be fully ſatisfied that they are not falſe, feigned, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick conceits of deluded men, and not only ſo, but all theſe things may perſwade any rational man to try upon practiſe, whether they be divine or no.</item>
               </list>
And this never any did, but found the Apoſtles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be of God. If we had nothing but the univerſal and perpetual agreement and tradition of the Church of all places and times, affirming the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170310:57"/>Scripture to be the Word of God, it were ſufficient to produce in a rational man a greater meaſure of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, then any Book or Hiſtory in the world can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly require or deſerve. For this univerſal teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the beſt in ſeveral parts of the world, at ſuch a diſtance as that they in their time neither heard of, nor knew one another, makes it more credible then any humane Hiſtory can be. But to return unto Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> I ſay its poſſible, and not impoſſible to know the divinity of the teſtimony or declaration immediately, but not of the revelation or matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. Yet that ſuch a revelation, and ſuch a thing revealed there was, is known in ſome meaſure by conſequence. And the divine Authority of this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony may be infallibly known, and that by natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſon, yet by it as elevated and more perfected by outward repreſentation and inward ſanctification. And the matter of the revelation to another, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the manner, may be believed, though not known. For when we once know that God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it, we believe the thing revealed to be true, though by artificial and intrinſecal arguments we cannot prove it to be ſo. For the teſtimony of God may be evident, though the thing teſtified be hidden and above our reaſon. The Concluſion is, That we may have an infallible knowledge of the poſitive Laws of God, ſo far as to know that they are from him, and are his Laws, and that without particular revelation, that they were revealed to another.</p>

               </list>
For,
<list>
                  <item>1. To undertake to obey it, ſeems to be a promiſe to obey it: and this is a voluntary Obligation, whereby a man may bind himſelf to obey it as a divine Law, or as no Law, or if as a Law, yet not as a Law of God; and then he doth not obey as he ought to do.</item>
                  <item>3. It is abſurd, To obey it as a poſitive Law of God, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

               </list>
For though the active power whereby a man is enabled to believe a divine poſitive truth, be the gift of God, yet the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of this power, and the acts thereof, are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Law of God. Other wiſe poſitive unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a ſupernatural divine poſitive Law, ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared and propoſed could be no ſin. Its true, that ſome affirm that the firſt and natural acts of the ſoul are not ſubject to any Law: yet theſe do grant that all practical operations (and ſuch aſſent unto divine truths is) be ſubject unto Law. That faith is a duty, is apparent, becauſe God commands it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves it, rewards it, and reproves and puniſheth unbelief.

If a ſubject do accept the Religion eſtabliſhed by the civil Laws of his Countrey, he is free from civil penalties of man, yet not from the judgement of God, if that Religion be againſt the Laws of God. No Laws of man can bind above, much leſs againſt the Laws of God; and this all rational men will confeſs. <hi>Auſtine</hi> denies the perfection, and according to <hi>Tullies</hi> defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the very being of a Common-wealth to the Roman State, becauſe it commanded ſubjection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and worſhip of Devils.

               <hi>CAP. XI.</hi> Of the Second Part. The <hi>27.</hi> of the Book. Of crimes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> excuſes, and extenuation.</head>
            <p>THE Author in this Chapter is methodical, and cannot much be charged with errours or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſions, as in the former. The proper place for crimes excuſes extenuations and aggravations is next to that of Laws. For as the Apoſtle teacheth us, Where there is no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion. And herein the Authors of Politicks ſeem to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, becauſe, though they treat of Laws and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, yet they ſay little or nothing of Crimes. Yet the Civilians in this particular have done their part. He doth diſtinguiſh betwixt ſins and crimes, and his diſtinction may be allowed, though hardly in Politicks. Yet the word <hi>Crime</hi> in Learned Authors is not alwaies taken, as here it is, for an offence, as it is an object or matter of Judgement. And ſometimes cauſes judicial are diſtinguiſhed into civil, criminal, capital. In which diſtinction criminals are onely one ſort of mules. That which we call <hi>[Sin]</hi> in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is nothing but diſobedience to a Law in general, though it be ſtrictly taken for diſobedience to divine Law. Diſobedience being an anomy, preſuppoſeth a Law, and a Law muſt have a Soveraign and a Law-giver: and there can be no violation of a Law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wrong unto the Law-giver: And thoſe offences are moſt hainous, which directly oppoſe and wrong
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170310:60"/>the power of the Soveraign lawfully conſtituted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the tend to the raſing of the very foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conſtitution of the Government it ſelf. Such are, denying of the ſupreme power, reſiſting it, and revolting from it, ſo as to be Soveraigns our ſelves, or independent, or ſubject to another. The firſt law God gave was for to ſecure his Soveraignty, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me;</hi> as the Septuagint do well and truly turn it. And this by <hi>Philo</hi> is ſaid to be the Commandment <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of the ſupreme power of one God. All other offences are againſt the Laws of adminiſtration, which though they may be hainous, yet are not ſo hainous as thoſe former againſt the inſtitution. Theſe offences of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may be conſidered, either with reference to the Laws antecedent, as violated, or to Juriſdiction fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, in which ſenſe the Author handles them, and calls them crimes! And theſe may be reduced unto certain heads, as they have been by Civilians, and alſo by the Lawyers of particular States; yet this is moſt exactly done by the Common-Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which was entire before the Conqueſt, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the order of the ten Commandments of the moral Law of God. Thus ſome Antiquaries in Law do inform us.</p>
            <p>The Author acquits all motions of the ſoul ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to a deliberate conſent, reſolution, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from being ſins; yet this I cannot do. Its cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that to underſtand, know and remember that which is evil and unjuſt, cannot be ſin, becauſe God doth ſo: and all this may be done with a deteſtation of it; yet to like, approve, incline unto, delight in evil thus known and remembered, though we never
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170310:61"/>yield a deliberate or any formal conſent, muſt needs argue ſome imperfection, if not corruption in the heart of man, which ſhould never think of evil, but with hatred. The reſt of the Chapter is rational, if rightly underſtood, the greateſt part whereof is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up in that of aggravations, wherein he hath done better then others, yet he is far ſhort of ſome who have both more largely, and alſo accurately handled that point out of Scriptures. Its a common theme of Caſuiſts and Civilians, and might have been much improved. The original of all crimes and offences, are either from the underſtanding or the will, not the paſſions, as he affirms. From the underſtanding, either not apprehending, or not judging aright, from the will averſe, or enclined another way by reaſon of corruption. Ignorance and error are from defect, or negligence, or wilfulneſs, ſeverally or joyntly. And here its to be obſerved, That the more of meer will there is in any offence, the more hainous it is. The higheſt degree of wilfulneſs is in obſtinacy, reſiſting all means and motives uſed for to rectifie the heart.</p>

            <p>UPon obedience or diſobedience, follow puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or rewards, determined by Judgement, which is an act of Juriſdiction, and conſiders the Law as violated or obſerved. And here comes in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to order, that head of Juriſdiction in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, which properly is handled in that part of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks we call Adminiſtration. And he that undertakes to deliver a model of Politicks, and yet ſaith nothing of Juriſdiction, but proceeds from crimes to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>per ſaltum,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> doth, is but a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Author. But let us hear his definition of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
            <p>T. H.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A puniſhment is an evil inflicted by publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, on him that hath done, or omitted that which is judged by the ſame Authority to be a tranſgreſſion of the Law, to the end that the will of men may be thereby better diſpoſed to obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="114" facs="tcp:170310:62"/>
            <p>This is a very imperfect definition, and one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, the Author preſumes much of his own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and deſires to be ſingular; otherwiſe he had a better definition made to his hands. For <hi>poena eſt vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicta noxae.</hi> This puniſhment is defined in general, as it includes the penalties inflicted by Parents, Maſters, or any one who have power to command another: &amp; it reacheth the puniſhments executed by God. This definition may eaſily be made ſo, as fully to expreſs the nature of civil puniſhment intended by this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. But for the better underſtanding of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of puniſhment, we muſt obſerve, that it may be conſidered ſeveral waies.
<list>
                  <item>1. As determined by the Law, which binds the party ſubject either to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or puniſhment.</item>
                  <item>2. As deſerved by the party offending, who is bound to ſuffer it.</item>
                  <item>3. As defined by the Judge upon judicial evidence.</item>
                  <item>4. As inflicted by the Miniſter of execution.</item>
                  <item>5. As ſuffered by the party condemned.</item>
                  <item>6. As prevented by pardon out of meer mercy, or upon ſatisfaction made and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</item>
               </list>
The efficient cauſe of puniſhing in a Common-wealth, is the Soveraign or higher powers bearing the Sword; and as exerciſing Juriſdiction either by himſelf or his Miniſter. For a Soveraign doth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh as a Judge. The immediate and formal object of this act is <hi>noxa civilis,</hi> ſome offence or crime judged upon evidence to be a violation of the Law. The general nature of it is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, retribution. The thing retributed or rendred is ſomething that brings hurt or dammage to the delinquent or party offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170310:62"/>who as judged guilty, is the proper ſubject of it. Its called by ſome <hi>Malum triſte, proper malum turpe.</hi> The proper act complete and conſummate, is the inflicting of this evil determined by juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo as that the party condemned doth actually ſuffer it. All this for the general notion of it, may be obſerved out of the words of the Apoſtle, who ſaith, That God will render to them who are conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, indignation and wrath: tribulation and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gniſh upon every ſoul of man that doth evil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.8, 9. For here we have the Judge, the crime Judged to be ſo, the retribution or rendering, the thing or evil rendred ſo as to be ſuffered, the cauſe why its rendred. In this reſpect the higher powers are ſaid to bear the ſword to take vengeance upon evil doers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4.</p>
            <p>The ends of puniſhment are many.
<list>
                  <item>1. Some of them are to correct and reform the party puniſhed;</item>
                  <item>2. Some for example, that others may hear and fear.</item>
                  <item>3. The end of all puniſhments in general, is to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the power of the Law-giver, and the honour and force of the Law, to manifeſt Juſtice and the hatred of evil, and to procure the peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of the Community.</item>
               </list>
Before the Author pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to draw concluſions from his definition, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires how the Soveraign acquired the power of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing. And reſolves,</p>

            <p>This is ridiculous, abſurd, and grounded upon his falſe principles. For,
<list>
                  <item>1. The Soveraign is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of God, and is bound to do (ſo that he keep within the compaſs of his Commiſſion) that which God would do, and that is to puniſh evil. And as all his power of making Laws, Judgement, Peace, War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are from God, ſo is this amongſt the reſt. By whom he is made a Soveraign, from him he hath the ſword to puniſh. Men may give their conſent, that ſuch a man, or ſuch a company of men ſhall raign, but the power is from God, not them.</item>
                  <item>2. In the conſtitution of a ſupreme Governor, no man can Covenant to be protected or defended in doing evil.</item>
               </list>
Neither can any, or all higher powers in the world juſtly promiſe to protect any in evil: neither hath any man any power unjuſtly to preſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For that of the Author, that in the ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture every man hath right to every thing, is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe and abominable. When a man ſubjects him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto a Soveraign ordained of God, not only to protect the good, but puniſh the evil, he cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept himſelf from his punitive power, if he do ill; becauſe he ſubjects according to the juſt Laws of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170310:63"/>God, and cannot lawfully do any other waies. So that power to puniſh is given by God, not left by man unto higher powers civil.</p>

                  <item>2. That theſe puniſhments, as well as ſpiritual, are either of loſs or pain; <hi>poena damni aut ſenſus,</hi> privative or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive. The one takes away ſome good, the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts ſome poſitive evil.</item>
                  <item>3. That ſome of them take away life, either civil, as baniſhment, or natural, as death: and ſome take away ſuch things as make life comfortable, as goods; ſuch are ſines, and confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; or liberty, as impriſonment, bondage; or our honour, as all ignominious penalties. Thoſe which infer ſome poſitive evil contrary to nature, are all kind of tortures whatſoever, which cauſe pain in the body of man: and all theſe poſitive puniſhments tend to the deſtruction of life, either in part or in whole.</item>
                  <item>4. Theſe penalties are ſo to be inflicted, and in ſuch a meaſure and proportion, as that no man may gain by doing evil.</item>
                  <item>5. That though an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent perſon, as ſuch, cannot be juſtly puniſhed, yet as he is made one perſon with the guily, he may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170310:64"/>ſuffer. Some are one perſon with the guilty by nature; as children with parents, ſome by conſent, as ſureties with the principal guilty of non-pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or by Laws civil, as the ſubjects with the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign.</item>
                  <item>6. The juſt execution of judgement is a means to avert Gods wrath, to protect the juſt, to preſerve the State, and procure Gods mercy.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Rewards are contrary to puniſhments, and are due to ſuch as are loyal and obedient ſubjects doing well. Theſe either are ordinary, and general, as protection of life, liberty, eſtate; or extraordinary and more ſpecial, and ſuch as enrich or advance, or give priviledges, immunities, and exemptions. And theſe latter ſhould never be diſpoſed of but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deſert, and by this means they would encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the ſubject, and breed gallant men.

               <hi>CAP. XIII.</hi> Of the Second Part. And the twenty ninth of the Book. Of thoſe things which weaken, and tend to the diſſolution of a Common-wealth.</head>
            <p>ALL bodies Politick are truly mortal, as the Author ſaith, though not ſo mortal as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual perſons whereof they are conſtituted be. For by reaſon of ſucceſſion of theſe ſingular and ſeveral perſons, they are of longer continuance: and therefore ſaid to be immortal; the proper meaning whereof is, that they are not ſo mortal. Many States are conſtituted by degrees, not in a moment, or any ſhort time: and in the like manner, they decay by little and little, until they utterly vaniſh in a total diſſolution. And though both conſtitution and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution ſeem ſometimes to be fortuitous, yet they are not ſo: for its God who in his mercy plants and builds: and in his juſt judgement plucks up, and pulls down. This is the place aſſigned by Authors to the head of Politicks, which delivers the cauſes of the alteration, corruption and ſubverſion of States. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations of the forms of Government are ſometimes for the better, and ſo they are a bleſſing; ſometimes for the worſe, and ſo they are the ſame with corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. Corruption is from man; ſubverſion from God, as the ſupreme and univerſal Judge. Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on goes before, ſubverſion follows. And this corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is from the ſins and crimes of the Governors, or
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170310:65"/>governed, or both. The crimes of Governors are either Perſonal or Political: Perſonal are many times the ſame with the offences of the people: ſins of them as men: Political are ſuch as make them guilty as they are Governors, as ignorance, imprudence, negligence, in juſtice Political; and theſe not only in aſſuming and acquiring power, but in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame. The ſins of the people as ſubjects, are impatiency, when they will not endure the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of juſt Governors, good Laws, and impartial Judgement, a deſire of innovation and alteration of Government, without juſt and neceſſary cauſes, open rebellion, ſecret treachery and conſpiracy, ſedition and ſuch like. The ſins of both, which are perſonal, are impiety againſt God; injuſtice and unmerciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards man, the abuſe of peace and plenty to bravery, drunkenneſs, gluttony, lewdneſs, and ſuch like Vices. And when in theſe they become impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, incorrigible, and univerſally delinquent, their ruine is fatal and unavoidable: the harveſt is ripe, and the ſickle of Gods vengeance will cut them off.</p>

            <p>Judgement is publick or private; publick no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man can paſs; private he may; and that both of his own actions, and others too. The acts of others are private or publick: of both theſe he may Judge. Publick acts of the Governors are Laws, Judgements, Execution. Even of Laws he may, he muſt within himſelf, ſo far as they are a rule and bind him, enquire, examine and determine, whether good or evil. Otherwiſe, he can perform but only a blind obedience to the beſt: and if he conform unto the unjuſt, he in obeying man, diſobeys God, which no good man will do. In other acts which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently juſt, we may judge of them truly as they are, and no otherwiſe. Yet this muſt not be done to palliate our diſobedience to that which is juſt, or raiſe ſedition, or rebel; but we may complain to God, and by our humble prayers ſeek redreſs.</p>

               <hi>A ſecond Doctrine, That whatſoever a man doth againſt conſcience is ſin. The conſcience may be errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and he that is ſubject to no Civil Law, ſins in all he acts againſt his conſcience. Yet to him that is in a Common-wealth, the Law is the publick conſcience, by which he hath undertaken to be guided.</hi>

            <p>Conſcience is a mans knowledge of his own acts, as agreeable or diſagreeable to the Law of God. Its not a faculty, but an act of the ſoul: and an act, not of the will, but underſtanding, and the ſame as practical. The proper act is knowledge; the object is his own acts, and theſe acts not any way, but as agreeable or diſagreeable to the Law of God. For as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith, there muſt be <hi>applicatio facti ad legem:</hi> Otherwiſe a mans underſtanding cannot judge of it as conformable or not unto the Law of God. Theſe acts may be conſidered as to be done, or done. In the former reſpect conſcience binds as a Law, though it be not the Law, but preſuppoſeth or includeth the knowledge of the Law. In the latter reſpect it judgeth, and is a kind of judge of himſelf in ſome ſort as ſuperiour to himſelf. But before the tribunal of God it is a witneſs, and doth accuſe or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe. The great Queſtion ſo much vexed by the Caſuiſts, is whether an erroneous conſcience doth bind. But let them determine what they pleaſe; an erroneous conſcience in proper ſenſe is no conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170310:67"/>For an errour is no knowledge, but a defect of knowledge, or rather a plain want of knowledge, and alſo an act contrary to knowledge. Conſcience is a knowledge in proper ſenſe, and knowledge is true and certain: and its a knowledge of a mans own act or acts as agreeable to the Law of God; this an erroneous conſcience cannot be. That con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is ſuch a knowledge, is made evident by the Apoſtle, ſaying, That when the Gentiles not having the Law, do the things contained in the Law, they having not the Law, are a Law unto themſelves, who ſhew the work of the Law written in their heart by their conſcience witneſſing, <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 12.14, 15. Where we may obſerve,
<list>
                  <item>1. That the conſcience could not witneſs, accuſe or excuſe, except there were ſomething to be accuſed or excuſed.</item>
                  <item>2. The thing accuſed as evil, or excuſed as good, muſt be ſomething conformable, or contrary to the Law of God.</item>
                  <item>3. The conſcience could not accuſe or excuſe any thing as good or evil, without knowledge both of the Law, and of the act that was contrary or conſentaneous to that Law.</item>
                  <item>4. Therefore the Apoſtle before he makes mention of the conſcience, affirmeth,
<list>
                        <item>1. That they did the things contained in the Law.</item>
                        <item>2. They were a Law unto themſelves.</item>
                        <item>3. That they did by their conſcience witneſſing, prove or demonſtrate the work of the Law, (that is the work which the Law did command) written in their heart.</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
To have the work of the Law written in their heart, is to have a certain true knowledge of it, not an erroneous miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. But to return to the Author, Conſcience in proper ſenſe doth bind, yet not as it is knowledge, nor as knowledge of a mans proper act, nor as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170310:68"/>of the Law in general, but by vertue of the Law known as a rule of his particular act. For man being ſubject unto God, and under his Laws, cannot bind himſelf, and be his own Law-giver: but the Law of God, not an errour, truly underſtood by him doth bind him. But let the erroneous judgement of the practical underſtanding be called conſcience, as by a Trope it may, becauſe there may be ſomething of conſcience in it; yet whether can it bind or no? I anſwer, it cannot bind: for an errour of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, cannot be a binding rule to command the will of man; neither can it be a rule at all. Again, an erroneous judgement, eſpecially practical, is a ſin, and againſt the Law of God; therefore it can no waies bind; only thus far moſt Caſuiſts do grant, that by it a man is ſo far bound, as not to act againſt it; yet this it doth only <hi>per accidens,</hi> (for <hi>per ſe;</hi> he is bound to act otherwiſe then it doth dictate.) For becauſe God hath made a mans reaſon his guide, he muſt needs be much depraved in his will, that will act contrary unto his reaſon. And he that will not ſeruple to act againſt his erroneous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will be bold to act againſt his judgement right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed. But the full debate of this, I refer to another occaſion. And theſe things premiſed, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Whatſoever is not of faith, is ſin:</hi> and therefore whoſoever acts againt ſaith and conſcience, properly ſo taken, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth: and for him to affirm that the true Doctrine of God revealed in the Scripture, ſhould be either falſe, or deſtructive of eivil States and Governments, is no waies tolerable. Whereas he alledgeth, that the Law of the Common-wealth is the publick conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170310:68"/>by which the ſubject hath bound himſelf to be guided, its too looſe and fallacious, if examined. For,
<list>
                  <item>1. The Law is not the publick conſcience, but the publick rule of conſcience in matters civil.</item>
                  <item>2. Its a rule of the ſubjects obedience, not as its a Law of the Common-wealth, but as it is agreeable and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to an higher Law, the Law of God. For the Laws civil do not immediately bind the conſcience and immortal ſoul, as the civil Soveraign hath no power to puniſh it; for his ſword cannot reach that ſpiritual ſubſtance; Secondarily and by conſequence they may oblige the ſoul.</item>
                  <item>3. No ſubject may or ought to make the Law of the State his abſolute guide. For the Law may be againſt the Law of God; and then, how can the ſubject undertake to obey it, and make it his rule, and not offend God?</item>
                  <item>4. Every ſubject is firſt bound and ſubject unto God, before he be ſubjected to civil powers: and is firſt bound to obey God more then man; and as his ſubjection unto man is but conditional and ſubordinate to his ſubjection to God, ſo his obedience to man is limited, and only to be performed in ſuch things as his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and abſolute Lord doth allow him.</item>
               </list>
And though man may ſuffer for his diſobedience to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws, yet he had better ſuffer a temporal then an eternal penalty; and offend man rather then God. Neither doth this doctrine any waies prejudice the civil power, nor encourage any man to diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and violation of civil Laws, if they be juſt and good, as they ought to be: and the ſubject hath not only liberty, but a command to examine the Laws of his Soveraign, and judge within himſelf, and for himſelf, whether they be not contrary to the Laws of his God.</p>

And there can be no doubt of this to ſuch as believe the Scripture to be the Word of God written, wherein we read, <hi>That except a man be born again of water and the ſpirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God, John</hi> 3.5. <hi>And no man can come unto me except the Father draw him, cap.</hi> 6.44.

This revelation was an inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or infuſion, except we will quarrel with words; and it was not natural; for then it might have been by and from fleſh and blood; but it was ſupernatural and from God revealing, not only outwardly, but inwardly too. It is alſo further taught us in Scripture, <hi>That no man can ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt is the Lord but by the Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. Yet this faith and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are ſo wrought in us, as that ordinarily God makes uſe of the Scriptures taught, explained, applyed unto
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170310:69"/>mans heart, of hearing, ſtudy and meditation, which are acts of reaſon, and ſuch acts as man may natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perform, and alſo ſo neglect them, as to give God juſt cauſe to deny the inſpiration of his Spirit for to make the word taught, heard, meditated effectual upon his heart. This Doctrine hath been believed and profeſſed in the moſt peaceable Common-wealths of the world, and did ſtrengthen, not weaken, much leſs diſſolve the ſame.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170310:70"/>yet though Soveraigns are above their own Laws, (how otherwiſe could they diſpenſe with them and repeal them?) wiſe men have given advice to Princes for to obſerve their own Laws, and that for example unto others, and good Princes have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this advice Soveraigns are to govern by Laws, not to be ſubject unto them, or as Subjects obey them, or be puniſhed by them. But what this man means by Soveraign, in the <hi>hypotheſis,</hi> is hard to know. For he preſuppoſeth all Soveraigns abſolute, and all Kings of <hi>England</hi> ſuch Soveraigns; and ſo in general it may be granted, that all Soveraigns are above the Laws civil; yet the application of this rule to particular Princes of limited power, may be falſe and no waies tolerable. The queſtion is not ſo much concerning the ſuperiority of the Soveraign over the Laws; but whether a Soveraign by Law for Adminiſtration, who is not ſole Legiſlator, is not in divers reſpects inferiour to the Law; or whether an an abſolute Soveraign may not ceaſe to be ſuch, and <hi>ex obligatione criminis, ex ſuperiore fieri inferior.</hi>

               <hi>A fifth Doctrine which tendeth to the diſſolution of a Common-wealth is, That every man hath an abſolute propriety in his goods, ſuch as excludeth the right of the Soveraign.

If the ſubject have propriety, as the Author grants, it muſt needs be abſolute, and muſt needs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude not only the right of the fellow-ſubject, but of the Soveraign too. For propriety in proper ſenſe is an independent right of total alienation, without any licenſe of a Superiour or any other.</item>
                  <item>2. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety is not derived from the Soveraign, except he be deſpotical; and ſuch indeed the Author affirmeth all Soveraigns to be: and in that reſpect the ſubjects can neither have propriety nor liberty; therefore he contradicts himſelf, when he ſaith in many places, that the Soveraign is abſolute, and here, that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject hath propriety.</item>
                  <item>3. Its to be granted, that even in a free-State, the ſubjects proprity cannot free from the publick charges: for as a Member of the whole body, he is bound to contribute to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the State, without the preſervation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he cannot ſo well preſerve his own private right.</item>
                  <item>4. Propriety is by the Law of Nature and Nations at leaſt agreeable unto both. And when men agree to conſtitute a Common-wealth, they retain their proper right, which they had unto their goods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Conſtitution, which doth not deſtroy, but preſerve propriety, if well ordered.</item>
               </list>
For men may advance a Soveraign without any aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their eſtates. No man hath any propriety from God, but ſo as to be bound to give unto the poor, relieve the diſtreſſed, and maintain the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign in his juſt Government; yet this doth not take away, but prove propriety, becauſe every one
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170310:71"/>gives, even unto the Common-wealth, that which is his own, not another mans, nor his Soveraigns, who may juſtly in neceſſary caſes, for the preſervation of the State, impoſe a juſt rate upon the ſubject.</p>

This did poiſe and limit the regal power, prevented much riot and exceſs in the Court, made the Prince frugal, and hindred unneceſſary wars.

               <hi>There is a ſixth Doctrine plainly and directly againſt the eſſence of a Common-wealth, and its this, That the Soveraign power may be divided.</hi>

            <p>The ſupreme power, as ſupreme, muſt needs be one, and cannot be divided. For as in a Natural, ſo in a Political body, there muſt be of neceſſity one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly principle of motion. One ſupreme will directed by one judgement, and ſtrengthened with one force of the ſword, muſt command, judge, execute: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there can be no order or regular motion. Yet this ſupreme power may be in many perſons, ſeveral and diſtinct phyſically, but morally reduced to one by the major part agreeing in one ſuffrage. That ſome have made in this State of <hi>England</hi> three Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate powers, with their ſeveral Negatives, and their ſeveral diſtinct rights of Soveraign power, can very hardly be made good by any reaſon, as I have hinted before. Yet even theſe do place all the <hi>jura Majeſtatis,</hi> in all joyntly. Our form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is confounded by the different opinions of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lawyers. Civilians and Divines, who neither agree one with another, nor amongſt themſelves. It hath been declared, That the fundamental Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Kingdom hath been by King, Peers and Commons; yet this can ſatisfie no man, becauſe there is no certainty what the power of Commons, what the power of Lords, what the power of the King is: Neither whether the houſe of Commons and of Lords, be two diſtinct houſes or no: Or if they be diſtinct, wherein they are ſo diſtinct. For ſome affirm, that in Legiſlation they ought to be but one, though in Judicial acts two. Yet ſuppoſe the Lords to have the Judicial power alone, nevertheleſs
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170310:72"/>its a queſtion what kind of Lords and Barons theſe ſhould be. We read firſt of the forty Lords of the forty Counties in the <hi>Saxons</hi> time: after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt we find three ſorts of Barons in the higher houſe: and they were <hi>Feudarii, reſcriptitii, diplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matici;</hi> Barons by Tenure, by Writ, by Patent. Lords by tenure were the firſt; but afterwards when any were called by the Kings Writ to Parliament, they by that very Writ were made Barons with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage amongſt the former; the laſt were Lords by Patent, and ſuch were moſt, yea almoſt all our Lords in latter times. And to multiply the laſt, was a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the King. For by that means, after the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of the Pope was caſt off, the Biſhops did whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend upon the King, and the Barons by Patent were his creatures, and by them he might carry any cauſe, or at leaſt hinder and croſs the deſires of the Knights and Burgeſſes. And herein few of our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Hiſtories can help us; becauſe they relate only unto us matter of fact, how ſometimes the King, ſometimes the Barons, ſometimes the Commons were aſcendant and predominant, as now they all ſeem to be deſcendant. Yet for all this, a free Parliament, of juſt, wiſe and good men, might rectifie all this, and unite the ſupreme power ſo miſerably divided to the hazard of the State.</p>

Yet with wiſe and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding men its of no force, becauſe they know full well, that ſome form of Government, which may be good to one, may prove not to be ſo to another; and that changes in this kind are dangerous.

               <hi>And as to rebellion in particular againſt Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; one of the moſt frequent cauſes is the reading of the Books of Policy and Hiſtories of the antient</hi> Greeks <hi>and</hi> Romans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This hath been formerly examined. The reading of theſe Books cannot do ſo much hurt, as this <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan</hi> may do: For it is far more dangerous and deſtructive of good government, then any of their Hiſtories, which can do no hurt to any but ſuch as are ignorant and ill-diſpoſed. In thoſe Books they may read of Kings and Emperours, and of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170310:73"/>as well as free-States; and few are ſo void of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, but that they well know they are bound to their own form of Government, and are not to covet every model they read of. Such men as he do ſhamefully debaſe free-States, as forms unlawful in themſelves, and ſo flatter limited Princes, as though they were abſolute Lords, and advance Monarchy ſo high, as though it were the only form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo inſtituted by God and commanded; that all Nations were bound unto it, and whoſoever doth not bow unto it, is a rebel againſt God. Yet he never inſtituted immediately any Common-wealth but one, and that was a free-State; and when a King was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, he was offended, and under a regal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it came to ruine. Whereas he thinks theſe Books do teach Regicide and killing of Kings, he is much miſtaken. For ſubjects to murther their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soveraigns, is an horrid crime, and ſo much the more to be deteſted, if done under the name of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicide. To plead for Tyrants really ſuch as ſuch, is to be abhorred. They pervert the very end of all government, abuſe their power, act contrary to the Laws of God and men, to the ruine of the State, are enemies of mankind, the chiefeſt agents for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. The Queſtion is, Whether a people having power in their hands, may not reſtrain, or remove, or put to death ſuch men, as being guilty of many crimes, which the Laws of God have made univerſally ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, ſo that no man in the world can plead exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption? Some think that they are to be left to God, and ſubjects muſt ſeek deliverance by prayers and tears; and the truth is, Chriſtians as Chriſtians, have no other remedy: others conceive, they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170310:73"/>and that by force, and their own ſubjects do it: Others give this power only unto Magiſtrates, or to ſuch as ſhare with them in the ſupreme power: Others are of a mind, that ſeeing they ceaſe to be Kings or Soveraigns, they may be lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tryed, and put to death, as well as private men; and that without any ordinary juriſdiction: Others determine this to be lawful in ſuch States as that of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> in <hi>Grece,</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi> What the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is, cannot be unknown. For the Pope doth arrogate an univerſal Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, whereby he may excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate any Chriſtian King, that ſhall not obey his Canons and Edicts, and upon this ſentence once gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he may depoſe him, free his ſubjects from their allegiance, and command them as Catholicks to riſe in rebellion againſt him; &amp; ſome of them have taught, that its a meritorious art to poyſon, ſtab, or any other way murther Kings for the promotion of the Catholick cauſe. This queſtion after the terms there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of clearly explicated, is of very great moment; and let men adviſe well how they do determine either in their own judgement privately, or before others.</p>

            <p>There cannot be any Soveraign but one, in one and the ſame Common-wealth: and to ſet up Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy againſt Soveraignty; Canons againſt Laws; Ghoſtly authority againſt Civil, muſt needs be a cauſe of diviſion, confuſion, diſſolution. Yet this will not prove any inconſiſtency of an Eccleſiaſtical independent power with the Civil Soveraignty, in one and the ſame Community. And the diſtinction of the power of the keyes given by Chriſt unto the Church; and the power of the ſword, truſted in the hands of the higher powers civil, is real, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies ſome things truly different one from another, though he either cannot or will not underſtand it. With Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> indeed this diſtinction can ſigniſie nothing, becauſe he hath given unto the civil Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign an infallible judgement, and an abſolute power in all cauſes Eccleſiaſtical and Spiritual. His diſcourſe may be good againſt thoſe Eccleſiaſtical perſons who have uſurped civil power; otherwiſe its impertinent and irrational. And he muſt know, that it is alike difficult to prove, That the State hath the power of the keyes, as for to evince that the Church hath the power the ſword. Its as great an offence for the State to encroach upon the Church, as for the Church to encroach upon the State; The Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> have been highly guilty of the one, and many proteſtant Princes and States of the other. And though men will not ſee it, yet its clear enough, that one and the ſame Community is capable both of a Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Government at one and the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170310:74"/>ſame time: and that the Church and State are two diſtinct Common-wealths, the one ſpiritual, and the other temporal, though they conſiſt of the ſame perſons. And theſe perſons, as Chriſtians, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſpiritual capacity, make up the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Common-wealth Chriſtian, which is the Church: as they are men, having temporal eſtates, bodily life and liberty, they are members of the civil Community and Common-wealth. The Power, Form of Government, Adminiſtration, Laws, Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Officers of the Church are diſtinct and different from thoſe of the State. The ſentence of the Church is, Let him be an Heathen, or a Publican, and the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution is expected from heaven according to the promiſe, <hi>Whatſoever you bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven;</hi> and this ſentence doth take away ſome ſpiritual, but no temporal or civil right of the perſon judged, though the judgement be paſſed and made valid, both <hi>in foro interiore &amp; exteriore.</hi> The ſentence of the civil State is, Let him be fined, impriſoned, ſtigmatized, baniſhed, put to death; and its execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſword. The ſeveral members of a Church National, and the whole Church joyntly, is ſubject to the civil power; and the civil Soveraign, if a Chriſtian, is ſubject to the Church, becauſe as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, he is ſubject to Chriſt, and bonnd by his Laws. And as a civil Soveraign, he is bound to protect the Church, and he may by civil Laws ratifie the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Canons, and then they bind not only under a ſpiritual, but a civil penalty too. If Church-aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies give cauſe of jealouſie to the Civil powers, they may regulate them, and order their proceedings; if they offend, they may puniſh them. Their perſons,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170310:75"/>lives, eſtates, are under the ſword; and if this be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them, becauſe they will not obey them to diſobey Chriſt, they ought to ſuffer it patiently for Chriſts ſake. In this caſe the Church may pray and weep, reſiſt and rebel they may not; for Chriſtians as Chriſtians, have no power of the ſword againſt any man, not their own members, much leſs againſt the civil Soveraign; whom if they reſiſt, they muſt do it under another notion, or elſe they tranſgreſs, and can have no excuſe. And here it is to be obſerved,
<list>
                  <item>1. That Chriſt gathered Diſciples, inſtituted Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcipline, made Laws, and the Apoſtles executed them in making Officers, <hi>Acts</hi> cap. 1. &amp; 16. made Laws, cap. 15. paſſed ſentence and executed the ſame, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. and all this without any Commiſſion from any civil Soveraign. Therefore its not true which ſome learned Divines have affirmed, That the State and Church are one body, endued with two powers or faculties; for they are two diſtinct bodies Politick. Its true, that if, as ſome conceive, there were no power but coactive of the ſword, then they muſt needs be one body. But there is another power, as you heard before.</item>
                  <item>2. If a King become Chriſtian, by this he acquires no power, not the leaſt, more then he had before: and if he be Heathen or Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and all his ſubjects become Chriſtian, he loſeth not one jot of his former civil power, which they are bound to ſubmit unto by the very Laws of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. If he command any thing contrary to the Laws of Chriſt, they may and muſt diſobey, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his power, they may not, they muſt not. In this caſe a Chriſtian may be perplexed between the Devil and a Goaler, as ſome of <hi>Scotland</hi> were ſaid to be,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170310:75"/>when if they obeyed the Parliament, and joyned with Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> to invade <hi>England,</hi> the Kirk ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate them, and deliver them up to Satan; if they obeyed the Church prohibiting them, they were caſt in priſon by the State. The cauſe of this perplexity is not from this, that the Church and State are two diſtinct Common-wealths, but becauſe the commands of the one or both may be unjuſt.</item>

               <hi>Some make the power of levying money depend upon a general aſſembly; of conduct and command upon one man; of making Laws upon the accidental conſent of three. Such government is no government, but a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Common-wealth into three independent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Here again he hath made the Parliament, which is the bulwark of, and beſt remedy for to preſerve our liberty, a diſeaſe; and hath turned the King, Peers and Commons into three independent factions; and this Government, he ſaith, ſome call a mixt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. Whether there can be a mixt State, is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in Politicks; yet if we underſtand what mixture is, and could determine, whether this mixture be in the ſupreme power as fixed in the Conſtitution, or exerciſed in the Adminiſtration, we might more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſatisfie our ſelves. But this hath not been exactly done. For its probable, that in the exerciſe of the ſupreme power, in the three acts of Legiſlation,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170310:76"/>Judgement, Execution, there might be a mixture, and theſe brought to a juſt and regular temperament. But a mixt Monarchy in proper ſenſe there cannot be. Yet a limited and well-poiſed Monarch there may be. To place the power Legiſlative, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all the reſt, in three co-ordinate parties, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every one of them ſeverally a negative, to me ſeems irrational; for it may eaſily turn them who ſhould be one, into three factions, as here it is affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: at leaſt it will retard all buſineſſes, which for for diſpatch, require ſecrecy and expedition. But to place the univerſal power originally in the general aſſembly without any negative; the judicial in the Lords, and the executive in the King, ſeems to be far more agreeable to the rules of reaſon. This ſome think was our untient Conſtitution, and the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.</p>
            <p>Difficulty of raiſing moneys neceſſary for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and preſervation of the State, monopolies, popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity in a ſubject, are diſeaſes which much weaken a State; there is no doubt of this. That one City ſhould in groſs the wealth and ſtrength of a Nation, and be ſo rich and populous as to be able to ſet forth a potent Army, and maintain it, may be judged very dangerous to a Common-wealth, as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us. By this City in particular, he means <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> which, as ſome tell us, furniſhed the Parliament with men and moneys, whereby the King was van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed and over-thrown. Yet they ſeldom did aſſiſt the Parliament but upon high terms, and advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to themſelves; in ſo much as their Petitions were Commands unto the Parliament, which did depend more upon the City, then the City upon them, by
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170310:76"/>which means they might in time engroſs the whole power, and ſo rule the Nation. Yet an army of their own did break their ſtrength, and reduce them unto their own terms: and its clear, that City depends much upon the River, both for fuel, merchandize and proviſion, and by a wiſe provident counſel may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily kept in order. And this might the more eaſily be done, becauſe the Citizens have ſo many ſeveral inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, and the ſame inconſiſtent amongſt themſelves, as that they can hardly be united.</p>
            <p>After all theſe diſeaſes from within, which weaken and may diſſolve a Government, he informs of a deſtructive cauſe, and that is a forreign or inteſtine war, wherein the enemy obtains a final victory, ſo that the Soveraign cannot protect his ſubjects in their loyalty. This indeed may cut off a line, change the Governors, and alter the form of Government. Yet in all this, the Community may continue, and never be like a ſubject matter without any form, but the Government may be the ſame, and the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors only altered; nay the Conſtitution may ſtand firm, and the Adminiſtration only varied: or if the the form be changed, yet the privation of the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is an introduction of the latter. Here its confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that when the power of protection faileth in the Soveraign, obligation in the ſubject is taken away. But he ſtarts a queſtion, though with him no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether the right of a Soveraign Monarch can be extinguiſhed by the act of another? He ſaith it cannot. Yet experience tells us, it may. For a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Monarch, fallen into the power of another, ceaſeth to be a Soveraign, and this is by the act of another. And again, if God by another take away
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170310:77"/>his ſword, though his perſon eſcape, and be at liberty, he hath but the name, and not the thing or real title. If his ſubjects freed from obligation, becauſe he can give no protection, do ſubmit themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, his right is loſt. If his life be taken away, and his line cut off, all right is extinct, and in all theſe caſes by the act of another; yet he thinks, that if the power of an aſſembly be ſuppreſſed, their right is extinct. The aſſembly in an Ariſtocracy, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy, for ſuch he means, may be extraordinary, or ordinary; and the ſame the immediate ſubject of the ſupreme power, or only truſted for a time with the adminiſtration and exerciſe thereof: and the power of an aſſembly may be ſuppreſſed for a time, and ſo only ſuſpended, the aſſembly remaining ſtill. Except he let us know what kind of aſſembly he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands, and what kind of ſuppreſſion of power he means, he doth nothing. An aſſembly whoſe power depends upon a certain place, time, number, may loſe their right, if once they be ſcattered or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in that circumſtance.</p>

               <hi>CAP. XIV.</hi> Of the <hi>2.</hi> part, the <hi>30.</hi> of the book Of the Office of the Soveraign Repreſentative.</head>
            <p>ITs very expedient for thoſe, whom it concerns, to know what Majeſty is, and what be the ſeveral rights thereof, as alſo that in every State it be fixed in a certain ſubject, perſon or perſons, that every one may know whom to obey and ſubject himſelf unto; yet the principal thing is for Soveraigns to exerciſe their power in the adminiſtration of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth according to the rules of Wiſdom and Juſtice, without which the beſt conſtitution in the world is in vain.</p>
            <p>It might be worth the while to examine what the Author hath delivered concerning the office of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Repreſentative, if he had informed us in this point of any thing formerly unknown or more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, then we read in other Writers. But he is ſo far from having done any ſuch thing, that he comes much ſhort of others. The duties of all Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors are moſt exactly taught in the Scriptures, which if this man had followed, he might have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Princes far more, and more excellent inſtructions.</p>
            <p>In this Chapter we find little but what we heard before; for it conſiſts chiefly in the repetition of his former rules, and his method is not exact. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes much of his own knowledge above others, and conceits he hath given us a better model of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then ever any had before; and ſo much he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires his own rules, that he thinks them worthy to be
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170310:78"/>taught in the Univerſities, and taictly decries all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Politicks, and undertakes to prove his dictates out of Scripture, which he can never do.</p>
            <p>Many of his Rules I confeſs are good, but moſt of them are ſuch as are very ordinary and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known. But in thoſe points wherein he is ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, he can hardly be excuſed from error. His firſt and chiefeſt care after the good of the people, is, to preſerve the abſolute power of Rulers, which he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts to be their due; and leſt they ſhould loſe any of them, he renews his Catalogue of them again. Theſe muſt be taught the people, that they may know themſelves to be abſolute ſlaves. And Princes muſt take heed of tranferring any of their Soveraign Rights unto another. But this was needleſs; for they have a deſire of power before they do obtain it: and after they are once poſſeſſed of it, they not only keep that which is due, but alſo uſurp far more then either God or man hath given them. Kings, who are but truſted with a limited power, endeavour to make themſelves abſolute Lords; and Deſpotical Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns muſt be petty Dieties. The beſt Princes had always a greater care to exerciſe their power well, then to enlarge it. And by their Wiſdom and Juſtice have governed more happily then any of theſe abſolute Soveraigns, who deſire rather to be great then good, and themſelves more honourable then the people happy.</p>
            <p>The Errours of this Author, vented in this part, as that Soveraign power Civil is abſolute; A civil Law againſt Rebellion is no Obligation; A good Law is not a juſt Law, becauſe no Law can be unjuſt. All his Rules of Government may be proved out of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170310:78"/>Scripture and other ſuch like, I will not here examine, becauſe ſome of them are ridiculous; ſome of them have been formerly anſwered: and his proof of theſe in his next part ſhall be diſcuſſed.</p>

In the latter he maketh uſe of man to ſpeak to man, the ſame thing he hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to man by Revelation: and the word of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to man is the word of Revelation from God: and the matter of both is the ſame. The word of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Providence is received by natural reaſon; the word of Revelation ſeems to be apprehended by reaſon ſupernaturally elevated and illuminated.</p>
            <p>The Kingdom of God is natural, or ſupernatural, according to the natural or ſupernatural Laws. The firſt Kingdom by the rules and dictates of natural reaſon directs man unto a temporal peace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity on Earth: The ſecond by the Laws of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation orders him to a ſupernatural and eternal peace and felicity to be enjoyed fully in Heaven. For the former end all civil Policies were inſtituted: For the ſecond the polity ſpiritual of the Church. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Laws of Gods Kingdom by nature were univerſally always declared even to all nations; the Laws of his ſupernatural Kingdom were revealed univerſally at the firſt in the times of <hi>Adam,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the dayes of <hi>Noah.</hi> But after a general Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, <hi>Iſrael</hi> was truſted with the Oracles of life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the exhibition of the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> and after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection the Apoſtles received a Commiſſion to teach all Nations, and make theſe Laws known more generally. So that this Author doth bewray his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in divinity; and pretending to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Scripture, he little underſtands them, and much abuſeth thoſe heavenly Writings. For the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170310:80"/>Kingdom of God by Propheſie was in all times, and confined in a more ſpecial manner for a time unto the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for a ſpecial reaſon. And at the firſt election of them after their deliverance from the Egyptial bondage, he immediately inſtituted not onely their ſpiritual but their civil Government. In which reſpect their civil government might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in a peculiar manner the Kingdom and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of God: and ſo the government of no Nation in the world could be accounted.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>The right of Gods ſoveraignty is not derived from Creation, but from his irreſiſtible Power.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>G. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is his great ignorance to think that Gods Soveraignty ſhould be derived from the executive power of force and ſtrength of his Godhead. For Dominion in general is twofold: <hi>Poſſeſſionis ant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giminis,</hi> of poſſeſſion or government. That of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion we call propriety: in which reſpect God is abſolute Lord of all his creatures, becauſe he createth and preſerveth them, ſo that their very being is more his then theirs. But his ſoveraign power over man ariſeth not onely from propriety in general, but from Gods propriety in him as a rational, intellectual crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ordinable to an higher end then the inanimate and irrational creature is capable of. For God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and preſerved him a rational creature; and both as a creature and as rational he is wholly his. As he
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170310:80"/>is rational, he is capable of Laws, Rewards, Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and hath a power to become Gods ſubject by voluntary ſubmiſſion and donation of himſelf, and alſo to obey his Lord and Maker. This no irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional being hath or can have. So that Gods Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over man ariſeth from Gods propriety in man as a rational being, and from the voluntary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of man as a rational creature unto his God who made him ſuch. Gods propriety in man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from creation and preſervation; and both theſe were not onely from Gods power, as Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth, but alſo from his Underſtanding and Will. For God by his wiſdom made the world as well as by his power, and worketh all things according to the Counſel of his Will. Dominion of government is not onely from power, nor by power alone; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, will and power, muſt all concur to Government. Therefore how abſurd is that aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his which followeth, If there had been any man of irreſiſtible power, there had been no reaſon why by that power he ſhould not have ruled. If this were true, a Leviathan, a Dragon, an Elephant hath more power then man; and why ſhould not brutes being ſtronger rule over men who are weaker? By this rule the ſtrongeſt man in a Kingdom ſhould be King: and he that hath the ſtrength of <hi>Goliah</hi> or <hi>Sampſon,</hi> ſhould rule over others, though they have ſtrength without wiſdom and integrity.</p>
            <p>T. H.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Kingdom over men, and the right of afflicting them at his pleaſure, belongeth naturally to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170310:81"/>not as Creatour and gracious, but as omnipotent.</hi>

               <hi>G. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obedience is due to God not meerly as gratitude to a benefactor, but as a duty unto him as a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver. For as a Creatour he may have a right to command, becauſe by Creation he hath an abſolute propriety in his being, which is ſuch as he is capable of a Law. And Creation is not to be conſidered as any kind of benefit, but ſuch a benefit as his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional being was wholly derived from it, and alſo wholly and perpetually depends upon his preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his eternal happineſs upon his legiſlation and judgement. And though he may afflict at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as omnipotent, becauſe as ſuch he can do it, yet he never afflicted any but as a legiſlatour and Judge, according to his juſt Laws. Becauſe God is omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent he can afflict, but it doth not hence follow that he will afflict. But he inſtanceth in <hi>Job,</hi> and the man born blind, both afflicted by God as omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: yet <hi>Job</hi> was upright indeed, but not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther innocent: and though God did manifeſt unto him his glorious Majeſty and Almighty power in his great works, yet this was not done to ſhew him the cauſe why God did afflict <hi>Job,</hi> but to humble him. And being humbled, he did not plead his integrity, but repented of his infirmity in duſt and aſhes. For though he was no hypocrite, yet he was a ſinner, <hi>Job</hi> 42.6. And though the blind man, <hi>John</hi> 9. was born blind, as we might juſtly be, yet he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and born in ſin as we are. But neither he nor
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170310:81"/>his parents were guilty of any ſuch notorious crime, as God doth uſually recompence with exemplary puniſhment even in this life.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Honour conſiſteth in the inward thought and opinion of the power and goodneſs of another; and therefore to honour God is to think as highly of his power and goodneſs as is poſſible. And of that opinion, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſigns in words and actions of men are called worſhip.</hi>

            <p>This is the firſt Law of Gods Kingdom by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in reſpect of God, that he is to be worſhipped. Worſhip is ſometimes an act of the ſoul terminated upon his Divine excellency and dignity: its called Reverence, and ſometimes Adoration. Sometimes its an act terminated upon his ſupreme and univerſal Power: And ſo it is ſubmiſſion to him as Supreme Lord and Law-giver. Sometime for obedience: and in this reſpect even the performance of our duty to our neighbours, as done in obedience to him as our ſupreme Lord, is an act of worſhip. And all acts of the ſoul terminated upon the Deity immediately are called worſhip. The worſhip of Reverence and Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is given unto God as moſt glorious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in himſelf, yet ſo manifeſted and apprehended. The worſhip of ſubmiſſion and obedience is given and aſcribed to him as Supreme Lord; and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of worſhip is ſome excellency apprehended
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170310:82"/>in the party worſhipped: And becauſe the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Deity is Infinite and Eternal, therefore the higheſt degree of worſhip is due unto him: even to the annihilation of our ſelves, the reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our very being wholly unto him, and the emptying of our ſelves into the Ocean of his moſt bleſſed Being. God deſerves and is worthy of all honour, glory and worſhip as excellent in himſelf. They may juſtly be required of the creature as depending ſolely and wholly upon him as Lord Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, Preſerver. And the creature is bound to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him by vertue of his Law and Covenant. By performance of this dutie we are capable of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal bliſs in and from him: and by his promiſe we come to have a right unto Eternal life.</p>
            <p>The Excellency of God is his moſt perfect and bleſſed Eſſence, which cannot be known by man as it is in it ſelf; yet its manifeſted to us by ſeveral di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct attributes, whereof ſome may be known by the light of Reaſon in ſome meaſure, but more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly by the Revelation of the Scriptures. Theſe At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes are many and diſtinct, and ſo given to God by himſelf: becauſe by one act of Reaſon we cannot conceive of or underſtand his Eſſence; which is but one in it ſelf, but repreſented to us as different and many, and ſo apprehended. And by our faith we believe the Divine perfections to be far greater then our Reaſon can apprehend them to be. They are in himſelf one infinite being, manifeſted by his works, and more fully by his Word. And our worſhip muſt aſcend above our Reaſon, and muſt be performed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our faith, which is a divine and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural light. For the diſtinct knowledge of this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170310:82"/>with the ſeveral acts thereof, and the ſeveral names, we muſt not follow the Schoolmen, but ſearch into the Scripture, &amp; diligently obſerve the uſe of the words, as they are there applied to ſignifie the ſame.</p>
            <p>How far Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> is from the true underſtanding of worſhip in general, and of the worſhip of God in particular, may eaſily appear from this, that he makes worſhip to be nothing elſe but the outward ſignification by words and actions of internal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; which with him is nothing elſe but the inward thought and opinion of the power and goodneſs of another. But neither is worſhip nor honour any ſuch thing as he hath defined them. And his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of worſhip with the diſtinctions will be found very poor upon examination, except we allow him a ſoveraign power over words to impoſe what ſignification upon them he pleaſeth, and the ſame different from that wherein they are uſed in Claſſical Authors.</p>
            <p>Thus he hath finiſhed his Politicks, ſet forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Leviathan in the Frontiſpiece: And though many have in this kind of learning far excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him: yet he thinks it clear and the beſt, and moſt rational, though it neither agree with reaſon or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And though his hope is not much, yet ſome hope he hath ſome Soveraign may put it in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. If they have no better directions, they may make uſe of his principles, as ſome have done to their ruine. Princes and Miniſters of State have no need to be taught them: for they know them too well and follow them too much.</p>

            <p>MR. <hi>Hobbs</hi> in the former part ſeemed to have ſome uſe of his Reaſon; but in this he is like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch as are lunatick, though now and then he hath his <hi>Lucida Intervalla.</hi> And whether he hath done thus out of ignorance or deſign, I know not; but this I know that he is deeply guilty of Errour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. He hath taught us little that is good and ſolid; much which is dangerous and damnable. The judicious Reader (if any ſuch will vouchſafe to read him) will reject and that with ſcorn and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, many things in the Book; but ſome ſimple giddy fools, eſpecially in theſe Lunatick times, may be taken with his fooleries, and blaſphemies. His deſign is to take all power from the Church, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne Chriſt, and confer all ſpiritual power in matters of Religion upon the civil Soveraign, and this directly contrary to expreſs Scripture. He hath turned the Pope out of his infallible Chair, and transformed ſoveraign civil Princes and Rulers into Popes; and to them in higheſt points, which concern out eternal ſalvation, we muſt captivate our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It ſeems to be a fault to ſpend any time in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering him, and for the ſame I may be cenſured, either as a fool, or as one ill-imployed; yet becauſe his doctrine, though it can do no good, yet may do hurt, and that to many, I will, yet but briefly, ſay ſomething to him.</p>
            <pb n="157" facs="tcp:170310:83"/>
            <p>The very Title of this part is ambiguous, and as he here underſtands it uncouth. For he determines the ſubject to be a Chriſtian-Common-wealth, and in that ſenſe as not any other hath taken it. For a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian-Common-wealth is either a Government of Chriſtians as Chriſtians, and that is called the Church, either as univerſally conſidered ſubject unto Chriſt her Lord and King, or as it is divided into ſeveral particular aſſociations under ſome form of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; and Chriſtian its called moſt uſually, as believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and profeſſing the faith of Chriſt exhibited: or elſe its a Common-wealth civil which hath publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received and acknowledged the Chriſtian Faith. Neither of theſe wayes doth he underſtand it. For with him a Chriſtian Common-wealth is ſuch a State wherein the people depend upon and muſt abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmit unto the ſoveraign civil profeſſing himſelf a Chriſtian, as infallible in all matters of Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline: and he derives the Authority of the Canon of the Scripture from him: yet neither Reaſon nor Scripture ever taught him any ſuch Doctrine. But let us hear what he profeſſeth, for thus we read in him.</p>
            <p>T. H.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And this Scripture it is out of which I am to take the principles of my Diſcourſe concerning the rights concerning thoſe who are the ſupreme Governours on earth of Chriſtian-Common-wealths, and of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſtian ſubjects towards their Soveraigns.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="158" facs="tcp:170310:84"/>
            <p>This is the ſubſtance as it is the Concluſion of his firſt Chapter. The Rule of all diſcourſe that is true, muſt be the Word of God either natural or prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick as he expreſſeth himſelf. The prophetick word we Chriſtians do affirm to be contained in the Scriptures, which once granted to be the word of God written, muſt of neceſſity be believed as infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly true by a natural principle. That God is true and truth it ſelf, not accidentally but Eſſentially; That the Prophets and Apoſtles knew them immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to be the word of God, he ſeems to confeſs. But how we know them to be ſo is a queſtion. The ſigns or Rules to know a true Prophet from a falſe, he hath aſſigned to be two.
<list>
                  <item>1. The matter of the Revelation.</item>
                  <item>2. The miracles done for confirmation.</item>
               </list>
But of this in the former part that which is ſufficient hath been ſaid. By Scripture we underſtand the word of God written: to be written is but an adjunct to the word of God, which is the word of God, and may be ſo though never written; yet it pleaſed God to cauſe it to be written, that it might be preſerved more pure and entire and be continued as a laſting Monument and record in the Church: and as he directed the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles in the ſpeaking of it to be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, ſo he likewiſe made them infallible in the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Words and writings are but ſigns of that which God revealed, they underſtood, declared; and that by us being truly underſtood and rightly applyed according to the intention of the Revelation ought to be our Rule. But if this be miſunderſtood and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170310:84"/>miſapplyed as by this Author they are, they cannot direct us, mislead us they may.</p>
            <p>And here we muſt diſtinguiſh between the entire Canon of the Scripture, and the principal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended matter therein contained as neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The Canon is ſo many ways and ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed, that no other Book in the world can be in this reſpect parrallel with it, and it were irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to reject it. The books of this Canon are uſually diſtinguiſhed into three kinds; <hi>Hiſtorical, Prophetical, Doctrinal.</hi> In the Hiſtorical part, that which may ſeem to be moſt incredible, is far more credible then many things commonly and generally believed in all Religions, and upon far leſs probable grounds; This the Ancient Fathers and Divines have made evident againſt the greateſt Schollars of the world, who did except againſt theſe Books. And in particular <hi>Cyril</hi> againſt <hi>Julian.</hi> The Prophetical hath been proved in a great part by God himſelf to the leaſt particulars fulfilling what he hath foretold. The Doctrinal part is either Moral or Poſitive: Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals few rational men do queſtion, becauſe they have ſome affinity with the internal Principles of natural Reaſon. The Poſitives are ſuch as Reaſon cannot reach, and therefore required at the firſt publication at leaſt ſome extraordinary confirmation, that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might be certain they were revealed by God: Theſe Poſitives are, that the Son of God was incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that he by the ſacrifice of his body and death upon the Croſs did expiate the ſin of man: That he roſe from the dead, aſcended into Heaven; ſits at the right hand of God, and Reigns in Heaven and Earth; ſhall come to judge both quick and dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:170310:85"/>The Signs and Wonders done by the Apoſtles, the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, and Gods powerful working of the Spirit upon the ſouls of men upon the preaching, hearing and receiving of theſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitives, did ſufficiently teſtifie they were from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. For in confirmation of the Poſitives, not the Morals, theſe things were done by God. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them is ſuch, as that though no Reaſon can prove, yet no Reaſon can contradict juſtly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is nothing in them contrary to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of pure Reaſon. They are propoſed unto us with ſuch credit, and urged upon us as matters of greateſt concernment in the world, in ſo much that he cannot be rational that ſhall refuſe either to give aſſent unto them, or make trial of them with the ſincere heart: which once done, he ſhall find by reall effects in the heart, not only that God did reveal them as he believed before by an acquired faith, but have an intuitive knowledge that they are Gods teſtimony, becauſe he who ſpake by the Scriptures and the Miniſters, hath ſpoken to him immediately by his ſpirit working in his heart: and then Reaſon is ſatisfied and convinced that God hath ſpoken, and thereupon ceaſeth to deny, and oppoſe, and yields a firm aſſent. And to conclude this point, whereof <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> had formerly ſpoken, if we will but conſider what kind of men have queſtioned or oppoſed the divinity of the Scripture, we ſhall find it in that very thing to be much honoured <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and the reaſon why men do not believe them, is not onely the imperfection but the corruption of Reaſon and mans will. For moſt men love darkneſs rather then the light: and the Doctrine of the Croſs of Chriſt as it declares a deep
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170310:85"/>deſign of Gods Eternal Wiſdom, ſo its direct<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly contrary to our falſe notions and baſe luſts. And this is a plain reaſon why an acquired faith cannot be ſufficient to ſave any man without the powerful ſanctification of the Spirit, both to prepare the heart and work a Divine Faith, which can never take kindly in an heart that is not prepared. Theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures he pretends to make the rule of his enſuing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, yet its but a bare pretence; for he followes his own fancies and falſe notions, not the ſenſe and genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine mind of God in them. He doth not <hi>re ferre ſed ferre ſenſum,</hi> as grave <hi>Hilary</hi> ſaith.

            <p>The ſcope of theſe writings is to direct ſinful man unto eternal life. And becauſe this eternal life is vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in God and iſſues from him as the Fountain and Author thereof, therefore in the ſame is revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Eternal, Infinite, glorious perfection of God in himſelf, and alſo his glorious works of Creation and Preſervation, his ſupreme and univerſal Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his Laws and Judgements and ſpecial government of man. And becauſe man as ſinful and guilty, is no ways capable of eternal life in ſtrict juſtice, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scripture directs him to God as Redeemer in Jeſus Chriſt, that by the obſervation of the Laws of Redemption he may be for ever bleſſed. Chriſt our Lord Redeemer is the principal ſubject of that Book of books: For <hi>Moſes</hi> and all the Prophets ſpeak of him as well as the writers of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, though not ſo clearly; and the doctrine of his Laws takes up the greateſt part of that Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though many other things are therein decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red yet in reference unto the principal ſubject and End. In a word, the end of the Scripture is to teach
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170310:86"/>us to believe and obey God the Father, Son, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, Creating, Redeeming, and Sanctifying us: if it ſpeak of civil Kingdoms, Laws and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, its upon the by, with reference to the eternal ſpiritual Kingdom of God Redeemer and Sanctifier: This end and ſcope is both obſcurely and confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared by the Author, as will more appear here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>The Authority of the Scripture is Divine; and ſo perfect, that it cannot be improved or impaired by all the Laws of all the civil Soveraigns of the world: Neither can the Angels in Heaven add any degree of Authority unto it; but if any of them ſhould (as they cannot) contradict it, they are by the divine Apoſtle declared to be accurſed. That any perſon or perſons do not apprehend it to be Divine, thats accidental, and cannot prejudice it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how vain, and falſe is that of Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> when he gives the ſupreme power of making it to be Law, and interpreting the ſame ſo made, unto the Civil Soveraignss? There is a two-fold Law; the one is Divine, and binds the conſcience immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: the other is humane and Civil, and cannot bind the conſcience, but per accidens. The Doctrine of the Scripture not onely in Morals but in Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives is Divine; and the precepts thereof, as being the precepts of God do bind the conſcience im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately: The Laws of Civil Soveraigns may bind their ſubjects upon peril of civil and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral puniſhment to receive them as authentick. But Laws they are and binding to obedience and belief, though there were no civil government in the world. The State and Church may declare them
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170310:87"/>to be Divine, but no wayes make them to be ſuch. And as our Saviour ſaid of his Doctrine, ſo its true of all the Scripture, that if any man will do the will of God declared therein, he ſhall know it to be of God. Its not ſo much the imperfection of our underſtanding, or the difficulty of the thing to be underſtood, as our diſobedience which is the cauſe why we do not ſee the divinity of theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Books. Theſe things being ſo, how abſurdly and falſly hath he ſtated the Queſtion concerning the Authority of the Scripture, ſo as to make it depend either upon the civil Soveraign in his Territory or upon the Pope? For thus he writes, The Queſtion of the Authority of the Scripture is reduced to this, Whether Chriſtian Kings and the Soveraign Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies in Chriſtian Common-wealths, be abſolute in their own territories, immediately under God, or ſubject to one Vicar of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas neither civil Soveraigns nor Popes can make the Scripture to be Law: but all Chriſtians are bound to believe the Scriptures to be the Law of God upon better grounds then civil laws or Eccleſiaſtical Canon; or elſe they cannot be ſaved by them.</p>

               <hi>CAP. III.</hi> Of the third Part; And <hi>34.</hi> of the Book. Of the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of Spirit, Angel, Inſpiration, in the Book of holy Scriptures.</head>
            <p>A Great part of his diſcourſe in this diviſion of his Book, is ſpent in the explication of certain words and terms much uſed in the Scriptures; and as he informs us, the reaſon of this labour is, to take away the ambiguity of the words, that his inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from them may be more clear and diſtinct. Yet he hath done it in that manner that he hath pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the genuine ſenſe of Gods Word, and ſo much as in him was, made it more obſcure, and which is worſe, hath falſifyed the ſame. Theſe terms have been examined and explained far better by more learned men, which I deſire the ignorant to conſult and adviſe with, leaſt they be ſeduced from the truth; For Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> in this particular work, as in others, is not to be truſted. But let us hear him.</p>
            <p>T. H.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Subſtance and body ſignifie the ſame thing, and therefore [ſubſtance incorporeal] when they are joyned together, deſtroy one another, as if a man ſhould ſay, an incorporeal body.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="166" facs="tcp:170310:88"/>

               <hi>G. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſignification of words, whereby we ſignifie our minds to others, is of great conſequence; and without the diſtinct knowledge of the ſeveral ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of one and the ſame words, we can neither underſtand the Scriptures, nor any other rational Author. This ſignification of words is either proper and Grammatical, or Tropical and Rhetorical. Of ſome words we have loſt the proper ſenſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt underſtand them according as they are moſt uſually taken in the beſt Authors. Theſe words <hi>[Body, and Subſtance]</hi> wherewith he begins his Scripture-<hi>Lexicon,</hi> are ſometimes taken in the ſame ſenſe to ſignifie the ſame thing, yet neither proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor moſt uſually. We find ſome of the antient Divines affirming Angels to be bodies and bodily creatures; yet by body they meant ſubſtance, and yet did acknowledge them to be Spirits. And for my part, I cannot be perſwaded that either Angels or ſouls rational are pure forms, as ſome, nay many Peripateticks do affirm. Yet they may be ſpirits, and this nature better expreſſed by the word <hi>[Spirits]</hi> then the word <hi>[Bodies.]</hi> And the vanity and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of this man is very much, who would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us, that <hi>[incorporeal ſubſtance]</hi> is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Some have obſerved, that the word <hi>[Guf]</hi> in Arabick and Rabbinical Authors, ſignifies,
<list>
                  <item>1. A body.</item>
                  <item>2. A perſon.</item>
                  <item>3. The ſubſtance or principal of a thing; yet no rational man, will hence conclude, that body and ſubſtance are the ſame.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <pb n="167" facs="tcp:170310:88"/>
            <p>The next word he undertakes to explain is <hi>[Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit]</hi> of which he ſaith.</p>
            <p>T. H.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the proper ſignification of Spirit in common ſpeech, is either a ſubtile, fluid, inviſible body, or a Ghoſt, or other idol or phantaſm of the imagination, But for Metaphorical ſignifications there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One word hath but one proper ſignification, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the firſt impoſition: therefore its not true, that there be three proper ſignifications of this word: and as for the improper, there may be and are many, and the ſame not only Metaphorical, but Metonymical, Ironical and Synechdochical. Yet he hath obſerved ſeven diſtinct ſenſes of the word <hi>[Spirit]</hi> in the Scripture. But he fearfully abuſeth ſome of thoſe places alledged by him, doth not reach the multitude of the ſignifications of the ſame in that holy Book, much leſs doth he reduce them into any Grammatical, Rhetorical or Natural method. If any man will but ſearch the Scriptures, he ſhall find the word <hi>[Spirit]</hi> therein to ſignifie above twenty ſeveral things. The original Concordances will make this apparent to an intelligent Reader, if he look but in the word <hi>[Ruach],</hi> which the Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint expreſs and turn by 14. ſeveral Greek words, the firſt whereof is [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Spirit</hi>] which is uſed by them moſt frequently by far, yet ſo as that by
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170310:89"/>that one word they ſignifie many things. And this word [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Spiritus</hi>] we find in the New Teſtament about 360. times, and in many places is very differently taken. The Latine uſe the word <hi>[Spiritus]</hi> in 15. ſeveral ſenſes at leaſt. By which it doth appear that this part of the Chapter cannot be read by Schollars but with diſdain and ſcorn: and eſpecially when he writes;</p>
            <p>T. H.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Other ſignifications of [Spirt] I find nowhere any; and where none of theſe can ſatisfie the ſenſe of the word in Scripture, the place falleth not under humane underſtanding,</hi> &amp;c <hi>as where God is ſaid to be a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had ſaid, that ſometime the word is taken for the diſpoſition or inclination of the mind, and then infers theſe words; when he doth not tell us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe be proper ſignifications uſual in common ſpeech, as the three former were, or they be Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical. If he mean, that beſides the three proper and theſe two, he finds none, his obſervation and ſo his learning in this kind is very poor. But whereas he will not have the place of Scripture, where its uſed in another ſenſe, to fall under our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he is abſurd. For the place, where its ſaid by our Saviour, that God is a <hi>[Spirit]</hi> may be, and is underſtood, though we have no demonſtrative or intuitive knowledge of the Deity in it ſelf. There is a
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170310:89"/>great difference between a word and the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the word. The word may be perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood though the thing be not: and we may know ſomething of the thing by ſome meaſure of knowledge, though we do not perfectly know it with the moſt perfect knowledge. Chriſt by theſe words did teach us ſomething; and if he did, how can it be ſaid that the place falleth not under our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding? For there is nothing teachable, which is not intelligible. And by that place we may eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that God is a far more perfect and excellent ſubſtance or being, then any inanimate or irrational body can poſſibly be. The next term to be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is that of Angel, whereof he ſaith.</p>
            <p>T. H.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is no place in the Old Teſtament, or New, from whence we can conclude that Angels are any thing permanent and incorporeal, or created, or any thing but an extraordinary manifeſtation of Gods power, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by dream or viſion: and the Angel</hi> Gabriel <hi>was nothing but a ſupernatural phantaſm. Yet from my feeble underſtanding, was by the plain texts of the New Teſtament extorted an acknowledgement and belief, that there be Angels ſubſtantial and permanent.</hi>

            <p>Much to this purpoſe in this part of the Chapter we may read. And in this particular he moſt woful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perverts ſeveral texts of Scripture, eludes the plain ſenſe, confutes his own belief, and is in effect a Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170310:90"/>To let him and others ſee his vanity and impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I will produce one place out of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where its written, <hi>Let all the Angels of God worſhip him;</hi> And of the Angels he ſaith. <hi>He maketh his Angels Spirits, and his Miniſters a flame of fire, Heb.</hi> 1.6, 7. where we may obſerve,
<list>
                  <item>1. That An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are perſons, and ſo permanent ſubſtances; for elſe how could they worſhip the Son of God incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate? How could they be capable of this command?</item>

                  <item>3. They were made and created.</item>

And both the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and the <hi>Pſalms</hi> are declared to be Canonical, and that by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to which he ſubmits himſelf. This is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to diſcover his ignorance and damnable errours in this particular, and to admoniſh all ſuch as are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with him, and eſteem him, to beware of him, and in no wiſe to truſt him.</item>

               <hi>Inſpiration properly is the blowing into a man ſome thin and ſubtile air or wind,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or if ſpirits be not corporeal, but have their exiſtence only in the fancy, it is nothing but the blowing in of ſome phantaſm. For Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be inſpired or given by inſpiration from God, is the inclining of the minds of thoſe men to write,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For the holy men of God to ſpeak as they were moved by the holy Spirit, is for theſe men to receive the voice of God in a dream or viſion ſupernatural: For the holy Spirit is nothing elſe, its not inſpiration,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <item>4. His production of ſome ſpecial ſupernatural effect, either upon the ſoul as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or affecting the thing underſtood, or as they uſually ſpeak, upon the underſtanding by illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, or the will by ſome ſanctification, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſoul or ſpirit is elevated above his natural pitch.</item>
               </list>
And the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, uſed by the Apoſtle, and tranſlated in Latine <hi>[divinitus inſpirata]</hi> and in Engliſh, [given by inſpiration from God] muſt needs ſignifie more then a flat and meer inclination. For if God had not immediately by his Spirit dictat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them, what they ſhould both ſpeak and write, and alſo in both directed them infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly, the holy writings had not been of divine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible and unqueſtionable authority, as all Chriſtians (who deſerve that name) believe them for to be. Neither could they contain the Word of God, but
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170310:91"/>only the word of man, who in ordinary things is ſubject unto errour. The ſame is alſo to be ſaid of the words of another Apoſtle, That the holy men of God did ſpeak as they were moved by the Spirit of God, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. That in this place, by <hi>[holy Spirit]</hi> ſhould be meant the voice of God in a dream or viſion ſupernatural, cannot be true. The holy Spirit is one thing, the voice of God another thing, viſion a third thing diſtinct from both: and both the voice and viſion may be called inſpiration either actively, or elſe paſſively. For viſion ſometimes is an act of the party inſpired, and an effect of inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is an inviſible and wonderful manner of communicating of Gods will and counſels immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately unto the intellectual creature. We are not ſo ſottiſh as to underſtand the words [inſpiration and infuſion] in the Grammatical ſenſe, as they ſignifie the breathing of one body upon another, or the pouring of water out of one veſſel into another. For then the Holy-Ghoſt ſhould be breath of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and water. But we do underſtand them Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically, as they ſignifie a ſupernatural communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of gifts.</p>

            <p>The Kingdom of God mentioned in Scripture is threefold,
<list>
                  <item>1. The Government of God over men in their ſpiritual capacity, as they are capable accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their obedience or diſobedience, of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal eſtate of felicity or miſery.</item>
                  <item>2. His govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over them in reſpect of their temporallife, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, eſtates on earth.</item>
                  <item>3. His ſpecial government both Civil and Eccleſiaſtial over the people of Iſrael after their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> until the time of the laſt ruine of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and diſperſion of them into all Nations.</item>
               </list>
The firſt begun preſently upon the fall of man, the ſecond upon the firſt conſtitution of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170310:92"/>civil States; the 3 about 2000 years after the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and continued till the captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet did not totally expire till our bleſſed Saviours aſcenſion into Heaven, and the fatal diſſolution of that Policy upon the deſtruction of the Temple. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever in reading the Scripture doth not obſerve theſe three diſtinct and different Kingdoms, cannot well challenge the name of a learned <hi>Divine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe may properly be called Kingdoms, becauſe in every one of theſe there is a Soveraign, ſubjects, Laws, Judgements, and executions. That Divines ſometimes underſtand by the Kingdom of God, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, which is the final eſtate of the ſubjects of his ſpiritual Kingdom, they cannot be blamed juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for in the New Teſtament many times, the term is ſo taken: yet theſe exclude either Soveraign, nor ſubjects, nor laws, nor any thing eſſential or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to a Kingdom; neither do they any ways by theſe take away or deny this three-fold difference of Gods Government. But that any of theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms ſhould be acquired by the conſent of the ſubjects, they have no reaſon to affirm. For God as Creatour and Preſerver univerſal, he hath abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power and dominion over mens ſouls, lives, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, eſtates; as Redeemer he hath power over their immortal ſouls, as well as by creation and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. As he delivered <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he acquired a ſpecial and peculiar right unto, and dominion over that people. Their conſent and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary ſubmiſſion did add nothing to Gods power, which before was abſolute and as high as could be; yet it did encreaſe their Obligation.</p>
            <p>That which he afterwards affirms, That he finds
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170310:92"/>the Kingdom of God to ſignifie in moſt places of Scripture, a Kingdom properly ſo named, conſtituted by the Votes of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in a peculiar manner, is very falſe. For 1. That Kingdom of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> was not conſtituted by the Votes of the people. 2. Suppoſe it had been ſo conſtituted, and the word Kingdom of God uſed in many places of Scripture to ſignifie that government, yet in the moſt places its never found ſo taken: neither can any man find it moſt frequently taken in that ſenſe. For this is remarkable, that it hardly ever ſo ſignifies in the New Teſtament, where we have the moſt frequent mention of the Kingdome of God: and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven ſignifying the ſpiritual (not any temporal) Kingdome of God Redeemer by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>T. H.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>From the Creation, beſides his natural reign over all, he had peculiar ſubjects, whom he commanded by a voyoc.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This Kingdom was continued in</hi> Noahs <hi>family; after this God made a Covenant with</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>and for memorial ordained the Sacrament of Circumciſion. And this was called the Old Covenant or Teſtament,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This Covenant was afterwards renewed by</hi> Moſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>The Kingdom ſpiritual is two-fold: the firſt by the Power and Law of Creation, requiring perfect obedience, without promiſe of any pardon, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer to expiate ſin, if man made holy ſhould
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170310:93"/>tranſgreſs: but this government laſted not long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Adam</hi> did violate it: and ſo the ſecond King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and government of God Redeemer by promiſe ſucceeded. This continued from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah,</hi> and was renewed to <hi>Abraham</hi> with the addition of the ſolemn Rite of Circumciſion, and the promiſe of the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> It was continued from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to the exhibition of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> yet with an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial appropriation of it to the people of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> All this is clear out of Scripture, and received by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conſent of all the Orthodox Chriſtians And here by the way obſerve,
<list>
                  <item>1. That he makes no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Kingdom of ſtrict juſtice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of Creation, and of that of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Chriſt according to the Law of Redemption.</item>
                  <item>2. That with him the Covenant and promiſe to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was the Old Covenant; whereas the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. and <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. affirms the contrary: and makes the promiſe 430 years before the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to be altogether different from the Law.</item>

            <p>Therefore Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his diſcourſe of Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom over the <hi>Jews</hi> is confuſed, falſe, and bewrays either his great ignorance, or negligence, or wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But he begins to act the Critick, and ſits as Judge to paſs ſentence upon the Tranſlations of thoſe words of Scripture, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5, 6. Thou ſhalt be a peculiar treaſure above all people, and a Kingdom of Prieſts. For ſo the Hebrew expreſſeth the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this people. But he curiouſly diſtinguiſheth between a peculiar treaſure above all people, and a peculiar people: yet theſe in ſenſe are the ſame; and alſo between a ſacerdotal Kingdom, and a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Prieſts, or Royal Prieſthood, yet theſe do not differ. And whereas the words are a promiſe of God engaging himſelf upon condition they will obey him; he makes them a promiſe of the peoples gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their conſent, that God ſhall be the Lord and Soveraign. But to whom was this promiſe made? onely unto the Prieſt, or to the Prince? No ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but to the whole Nation, and every ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ſhall keep the Covenant, and obey God. And this promiſe doth include the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning Chriſt. by faith in whom to come this promiſe was fulfilled to the Saints of old; and by faith in him already come, not onely to the believing <hi>Jews,</hi> but <hi>Gentiles</hi> it was made good. And ſo that place of 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. is to be underſtood, Which Text is not to be taken of Kings and civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, but all Chriſtians, truly ſuch indeed. For Chriſt by one offering hath perfected or conſecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſanctified for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. And waſhing us in his blood, hath made us Kings and Prieſts to God his Father, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5, 6. from that one place of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170310:94"/>
               <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.5, 6. miſinterpreted by two others, one of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus</hi> 2.14. the other of 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. and all miſ-applyed. He concludes that the Kingdom of God is a civil government over the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> wherein God was King: and the high Prieſt after <hi>Moſes</hi> his death was his ſole Viceroy or Lieutenant.</p>
            <p>After all this done, in this manner he endeavours to make his opinion good from two places Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, three Prophetical, out of the old Teſtament, and two others out of the New Teſtament. The two firſt are properly to be underſtood of the ſpecial govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God over <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The three Prophetical pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are meant of the ſpiritual Kingdom of Chriſt, and ſo are the two laſt, which are moſt palpably abuſed. For the firſt of them relates the Angels words unto the bleſſed <hi>Virgin,</hi> ſignifying, that her ſon Jeſus Chriſt ſhould ſit on the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> and ſhould reign over the houſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> for ever, and of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome there ſhould be no end, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.32, 33. Which is meant directly of his Spiritual, Heavenly and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Kingdom: whereof the Kingdom of <hi>David</hi> was a Type. For Chriſt never reigned as a temporal King over <hi>Iſrael</hi> according to the fleſh. The ſecond place is. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.10. Where our Saviour amongſt other things directs his Diſciples to pray, <hi>Thy Kingdom come.</hi> By which Kingdom is meant the Reign of Chriſt Incarnate and exalted at the Right hand of God, which was then to come, but now hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued 1600 years and upward; and yet all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans pray for the continuance, encreaſe, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the conſummation of the ſame, when death the laſt enemy ſhall be deſtroyed, and God ſhall be all in all, and reign moſt perfectly without any
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170310:94"/>enemy, without any oppoſition: Yet ſuch is his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable boldneſs, that from theſe places thus abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he confidently concludes, that the Kingdom of God is a civil government, managed by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Civil Soveraigns of the world.</p>
            <p>That Holy is the ſame with Publick <hi>per accidens</hi> ſometimes is true. But every thing that is holy is not publick, nor every thing that is publick holy. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his interpretation of the word Holy is not uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and at all times very Katachreſtical. For he can inſtance in no place, where its properly ſo taken, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be wreſted from the intended ſenſe. The meaning of the words Sacred and Sacraments are known to children out of ordinary Catechiſms, and therefore I forbear any further diſcourſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170310:95"/>or of, acts or operations in our ſelves, or our own being and eſſence. Now the word of God, which is God, is his word in himſelf of himſelf. And this term [Word] ſignifying the eternal Son of God and the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> is taken out of the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſt, as many expreſſions of the New Teſtament are: And ſome learned men have obſerved, that the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſt took that term from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Eſay</hi> 40.8.

The reaſon why we ſay the Scripture is the word of God written, is, 1.

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170310:96"/>a Metonymie its ſo called, becauſe it principally ſpeaks of God: and he is the ſubject of it, to which all particulars may be ſome ways referred or reduced.

And his end is to make a civil ſoveraign Chriſtian the ſupreme and infallible Judge. Prophets in Scripture are true or falſe, for falſe Prophets have the name. True are extraordinary, ordinary. Extraordinary are ſuch as either were Penmen of the Scripture; or ſuch only as whoſe Propheſies are related in Scripture. Theſe Prophets he divides into ſupreme and ſubordinate. Yet the Prophets extraordinary, as ſuch, can admit of no ſuch diſtinctions. Amongſt the ſupreme he reckons <hi>Moſes,</hi> the high Prieſts, Kings.

This end in general is the ſame with that of all his works, and that is the manifeſtation of his glory; yet in a more ſpecial manner, to awaken mens ſleepy minds and ſtir up attention, to perſwade and confirm the truth of thoſe Doctrines which are above the reach of reaſon; by this perſwaſion to work faith and converſion.

               <hi>CAP. VII.</hi> Of the third Part. And the <hi>38.</hi> of the Book. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning eternal life, hell, ſalvation, the world to come, and redemption.</head>
            <p>THAT there is eternal life, we believe, as alſo that it is an excellent, glorious, bleſſed eſtate, and the ſame to be enjoyed by certain perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in ſome certain place, and that there ſhall be no end either of the perſons or eſtate, or the enjoyment, we are fully perſwaded; becauſe God hath ſaid it. That the place is not this earth, we have ſome reaſon to think, becauſe our Saviour aſcended into heaven, and whileſt he was on earth made interceſſion for us, ſaying, <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, John</hi> 17.14. And to comfort the hearts of his Diſciples, ſad and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled becauſe he ſaid he muſt leave them, he uſeth theſe words, <hi>In my Fathers houſe are many manſions, if it were not ſo I would have told you: I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to my ſelf, that where I am, there ye may be alſo, John</hi> 14.23. If eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life ſhall be enjoyed on earth, why need Chriſt aſcend to heaven, there to prepare a place for us? and when he ſhall return from thence, why will he not ſtay here, and leave us on the earth, and never trouble himſelf with any tranſlation of us into any other place, where he ſhall ever abide, and we be ever with him?</p>
            <pb n="186" facs="tcp:170310:98"/>
            <p>Hell in Scripture, and as we underſtand God in that Book to teach us, is an eſtate directly contrary to eternal life. And we believe that it is a moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable condition of ſuch as ſhall ſuffer eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, and that in ſome certain place: and our chiefeſt imployment in this life, is to uſe all means whereby we may be freed from that condition, and enjoy the contrary. Concerning the particular <hi>[ubi]</hi> and diſtinct place, we do not, as we need not, much trouble our ſelves. To prove that both eternal rewards are to be enjoyed, and eternal torments to be ſuffered perpetually on earth, he doth moſt wofully wreſt and abuſe ſeveral places of Gods Book, and with ſo little ſolidity of judgement, that children may anſwer him.</p>
            <p>And becauſe this eternal life is prepared by God for ſuch as are by reaſon of their ſin, in danger of hell and eternal death; therefore in Scripture its ſometime called ſalvation, and alſo redemption; which is a freedom and deliverance from all the evil conſequents and effects of ſin, one and the principal whereof is, to be deprived of eternal bliſs, which conſiſts in full communion with our God. Yet the conſummation of both theſe conditions, is reſerved by God for the world to come, which will follow the univerſal reſurrection. The times of the Goſpel in reſpect of the Law, may be called [the world to come] and ſo ſome underſtand the words of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> 2.5. where we read that God hath not unto Angels ſubjected the world to come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Redemption is taken in another ſenſe, for the expiation of ſin, upon ſatisfaction made by Chriſt unto his heavenly Father as ſupreme Judge, who accepted his death as a ſufficient penalty to avert his wrath, and procure his mercy for all ſuch as ſhould believe on him. In this Chapter he hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon many places of Scripture, a ſenſe never intended; and this may be evident to any that can and will examine the places according to the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and the context. And he drives at this, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive Chriſt of his regal power, which at the right hand of God he now doth exerciſe, and to inveſt civil powers with it, till ſuch time as he hath brought Chriſt from heaven, that he may here on earth begin his perſonal raign. Sr. <hi>Thomas Mores <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia</hi> is ſomewhat rational, this diſcourſe is void of reaſon, and ſo much the more unſufferable, as the matter is ſo ſublime, and this ſacred Book of God ſo much profaned by him.</p>

            <p>IN the former Chapter he turned heaven and hell into the earth, and in this he hath transformed the Church, which is a ſpiritual politie, into a civil State; and that will eaſily appear from his definition of this excellent and divine Society.</p>
            <p>T. H.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Church is a company of men profeſſing Chriſtian Religion, united in the perſon of one Soveraign, at whoſe command they ought to aſſemble, and without whoſe authority they ought not to aſſemble.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>G. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many are the ſignifications of the word <hi>[Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia]</hi> in the Scriptures of the New Teſtament, as it is applyed to Chriſtians, which he hath in part, yet not fully obſerved. Yet amongſt them all from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end of the New Teſtament, its never found to be taken in this ſenſe; for as he hath not, ſo he cannot alledge one place where it ſo ſignifies.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170310:99"/>This definition is ſuch, as never any gave before; you can read it in no Author, neither can you prove it out of Scripture. Only the firſt words ſeem to have ſomething of a deſcription, but its no perfect explication of the quiddity and nature of the Church Chriſtian. For that is a ſociety or community of perſons, who believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and ſubject themſelves unto him as their Lord and King. A bare profeſſion will not make a man a ſubject of this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Kingdom. A ſincere profeſſion of that faith, which is ſeated and rooted in the heart, comes up higher, and is more fit to expreſs the being of a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of this Church.</p>
            <p>This Church as Catholick or Univerſal, ſubject unto Chriſt, is like a ſimilar body, and therefore the parts may bear the name of the whole, as the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and the Church in ſuch an houſe. Some part of this Church is under a form of diſcipline, to be exerciſed <hi>in foro exteriori,</hi> as the School-men and Caſuiſts uſe to ſpeak; ſome parts are not ſo happy. For this is not of the Eſſence of a Church. Its not of the being, though it tends to the well-being of the ſame. Some of theſe are ſubject unto a civil Soveraign who is a Chriſtian; ſome are not. For as a Chriſtian State may have Heathen or Mahumetan ſubjects; ſo Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians may be under the civil power of an Heathen or Mahumetan Prince. Both theſe therefore [to be under a form of diſcipline, and ſubject to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian civil power] are but accidental: and theſe accidents are ſeparable, and often actually ſeparated; and therefore, I know no reaſon why they ſhould be part of a perfect deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tion or ſo much as mentioned
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170310:100"/>in it. This may be ſufficient for to diſcover, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the man, and the abſurdity of the definition. Yet notwithſtanding his definition be faulty, I for my part do grant, that <hi>[Jus religionis ordinandae]</hi> doth belong to all Civil Governors and powers. But with limitation,
<list>
                  <item>1. That no Soveraign hath power to order, maintain, and promote any Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that which is inſtituted from heaven.</item>
                  <item>2. That they muſt not intermeddle with it for to order it, further then its ordinable by the ſword, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach Religion and Chrſtianity but <hi>per accidens,</hi> ſo far as the perſons who are Chriſtians, are ſubject to the civil power.</item>
               </list>
And this care of the Magiſtrate may do much good, not only in preventing all tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and ſeditions about Religion, as prejudicial to the peace of the State, and ſuppreſs them, but alſo protect the ſervants of Chriſt, and promote Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity very much. And in this reſpect only I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Soveraigns to be in all Cauſes, as well Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, as Civil, ſupreme Governors.</p>

Permiſſion perhaps they had, warrant they had none. There are actions, and ſuch as God commands, and civil Governors forbid, yet the prohibition of man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make void the command of God. For we muſt obey God rather then man: But he tells us</p>

            <p>
               <hi>That temporal and ſpiritual Government, are but words brought into the world to make men ſee double, and miſtake their lawful Soveraign.</hi>

               <hi>G. L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As Government, the thing ſignified by the word, is a real act, ſo ſpiritual and temporal Government, are two, not words, but things really different. For there is a temporal Government, which is not ſpiritual; and ſpiritual, which is not temporal. And
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170310:101"/>though he will not give us leave, (yet we will take it) to diſtinguiſh between Church and State; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and ſpiritual; man and Chriſtian. For he knows, and that certainly, there be men, who yet are no Chriſtians; States which are not Churches: and temporal things which are not ſpiritual. And thoſe things which not only may be, but actually are ſeparated in exiſtence, muſt needs be really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct. The rule is infallible, as its evident. And he that will confound theſe, may build a <hi>Babel,</hi> but no orderly ſociety. And its a fault, to make that which is double to ſeem ſingle, as well as make that which is ſingle appear to be double.</p>

And this is ſo done, that there is little fear leaſt any intelligent Reader ſhould he deceived or perſwaded by him: becauſe there is ſo great a diſtance between his premiſes and the concluſion, that no wit of man is able to ſee the connexion, or the illative force of them.</p>

            <p>This is the ſum of that Doctrine of Redemption delivered clearly and more fully in ſeveral places of the Scripture, eſpecially of the New Teſtament. Yet this Innovatour hath obſcured the ſame ſeveral ways, and determines the Kingdom of Chriſt to begin when the world doth end, becauſe Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Pilate, My Kingdom is not of this world, Joh.</hi> 18.36. From whence he concludes</p>
            <p>T. H.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Kingdom of Chriſt is not to begin before the general Reſurrection.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This is a groſs miſtake, and miſ-interpretation of a place which is clear in it ſelf. For by his gloſs he makes the Scripture to contradict it ſelf. Chriſt was
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170310:104"/>then <hi>Candidatus imperii;</hi> and was King when he gave this anſwer unto <hi>Pilate:</hi> yet he began to reign and exerciſe his Royal power more eminently when he was ſet at the Right hand of the Father: yet his Kingdom was not of this world, that is, not civil, but ſpiritual: and as <hi>Auſtin</hi> upon the place, It was, <hi>Hic non hinc:</hi> in the world, not of the world: in the world, yet not worldly, but divine and far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then the Kingdoms of the world. This is the genuine ſenſe of the words. That Chriſt doth reign now, and hath reigned ſince his aſcenſion and ſitting at the right hand of God, is evident. Before his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion he lets his Apoſtles know that all power in heaven and earth was given him, and according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and by vertue of that power he gave Commiſſion to his Apoſtles to teach and baptize, and perſwade men to the obedience of his commands, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18, 19, 20. He that hath an univerſal power in heaven and earth; who makes officers and gives them pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; who makes Laws, Inſtitutes Sacraments, and ſends down the Holy Ghoſt, muſt needs reign, and his Kingdom is begun already. We read that Chriſt muſt reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet: and the laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is death. And when all things ſhall be ſubdued unto him, then ſhall alſo the Son of man be ſubject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25, 26, 28. Where firſt from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. The Apoſtle tels us, <hi>That Chriſts Kingdom did Commence at the time of Chriſts ſitting at the right hand of God.</hi>

                  <item>2. That with him to ſit at the right hand of God is to reign.</item>

Before that time indeed he will not proceed to the final and univerſal ſentence and execution of the ſame. Yet there are many acts of government be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides judgement, and many acts of judgement be ſides thoſe of the general Aſſizes and laſt Seſſions. To make Laws, reduce men to ſubjection, appoint Officers, paſs ſentence, and execute the ſame in the very ſouls of men, are acts of one that reigns; as likewiſe to ſubdue enemies, Sin, Satan, and the world, to protect the Church: And in this manner Chriſt hath reigned ſince his Aſcenſion. And many Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do adore him, ſubject themſelves unto him, and obey him to this day. Yet with this man Chriſt doth not yet reign. Let him read <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2. throughout. It began to be fulfilled upon his Reſurrection and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion, as appears out of the Acts of the Apoſtles and their Epiſtles: And if he or any other ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the preſent reign of Chriſt, they muſt expect with his Iron Scepter to be daſht in pieces like a Potters Veſſel.</p>

            <p>AFter he had enthroned Civil Soveraigns, <hi>cap.</hi> 40. Dethroned Chriſt in the former Chapter: In this he takes away all power from the Church, and inveſts the Chriſtian civil powers with it. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it may be a queſtion whether his ignorance or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is the greater: for he is highly guilty of both. He that will determine the controverſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the power of the Church, muſt diſtinguiſt the univerſal power of God, the ſpiritual power of Chriſt incarnate and exalted to the Throne of glory, and the power deligated from Chriſt unto the Church univerſal here on earth, as ſubject unto Chriſt as Lord and Monarch; and alſo that which every particular Independent, aſſociation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians is truſted withal, for to preſerve the Society and the Ordinances of God from profanation. This he hath not done, and therefore little or rather no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be expected from him. This laſt power of particular Churches, is called the power of the keys <hi>in foro exteriori,</hi> in the particular government of their ſeveral combinations; for there is no ſupreme univerſal Independent judicatory on earth to which all Churches in the world are bound to appeal in this outward viſible adminiſtration. General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels can be no ſuch thing: Neither was there ever any <hi>Oecumenical</hi> Synod in proper ſenſe ſince the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170310:105"/>Goſpel was preached to all Nations. This power of outward Diſcipline is challenged by the Pope, by the Clergy, by the people Chriſtian, and by the States civil and Soveraigns of the world. And in this laſt party is the Author deeply engaged; but upon what reaſon I know not, except he intends to ſide with the ſtrongeſt, for ſuch are they which bear the ſword.</p>
            <p>The power of ordaining Miniſters, preaching the Word, adminiſtring the Sacraments was in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church ſince the time of the Apoſtles. And in every particular Church reduced to a form of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſcipline, there is a power of making Canons, of juriſdiction, of making Officers ſo far as ſhall conduce unto the better ordination of Miniſters, the preſervation of the purity of Doctrine, and the right adminiſtration of the Sacraments, leaſt they be profaned, and Chriſt offended by the admiſſion of ignorant, ſcandalous and unworthy perſons. There is a power alſo of diſpoſing and diſpenſing of thoſe goods which are given to the Church for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Chriſtian Religion. Civil Chriſtian States may and ought to make civil Laws to confirm the juſt Canons and juriſdictions of the Church. And thoſe Laws may be a fence unto it againſt theſe who ſhall oppoſe or perſecute. Yet when all this is done, thoſe Laws are but Civil, though the object of them be Eccleſiaſtical matters.</p>
            <p>This might ſuffice for to confute and make void the main body, and break in pieces the main deſign of this long and tedious Chapter, wherein he is not content to vent his errours, but he muſt broach his blaſphemies. For after he had granted the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical

                  <item>2. What worſhip we muſt perform unto the Deity, and how, and upon what grounds.</item>

Thoſe who being taught, profeſs their faith in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and promiſe to obey the commands of Chriſt, may be baptized and ſolemnly admitted into the Church. They who continued to profeſs their faith, &amp; to perform their promiſe of obedience unto Chriſt, might be continued in this ſociety, and enjoy the priviledges; otherwiſe not. From which words its evident, there muſt be a power to teach, baptize, abſolve, excommunicate: and alſo to ordain and deſign fit perſons to do theſe things, and give rules out of the Goſpel how they may be done aright.</p>
            <p>This Author firſt makes void as he conceives, all <hi>Bellarmines</hi> diſcourſe concerning the form of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical government: whether it be Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Ariſtocratical, or Democratical. 2. They have power but to teach. The reaſon why <hi>Bellarmines</hi> diſcourſe is void, is given by him to be this, becauſe
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170310:107"/>the Church hath no coercive power. If he mean co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercive civil by the ſword, its certain there is no ſuch power Eccleſiaſtical: Neither doth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm or challenge it but <hi>indirecte &amp; per accidens.</hi> Yet he was told before that the execution of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches cenſure is from heaven, as it is paſſed in the name of Chriſt and by his power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. And he hath promiſed, whatſoever is bound on earth ſhall be bound in heaven; and whatſoever looſed on earth ſhall be looſed in heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18. This is not in the name of the civil Soveraign, nor by the power of the ſword. And it muſt be done by ſome power: and this power muſt be exerciſed either by one, or more, or all, according to ſome certain order. And Government is nothing but <hi>ordo imperii &amp; ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Church hath but power to teach, perſwade, counſel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he proves firſt by his falſe ſuppoſition that Chriſt doth not reign until the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Reſurrection: ſecondly, by that time of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, which he bounds within the terms of Chriſts aſcenſion and his ſecond coming to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The former argument was grounded upon a falſe interpretation of our Saviours words, and ſo the later is; for by Regeneration in <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.28. is meant the Reſurrection, and ſo its printed and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in divers coples, and ſo the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles read it, as others alſo: and the ſenſe is, they which have followed me, ſhall in the Regeneration, that is, Reſurrection, ſit upon twelve Thrones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe that regeneration be not the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Yet it cannot be a time of that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as to reach Chriſts coming to Judgement, but
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170310:107"/>only the time of their following Chriſt, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not extend beyond his aſcention. Yet let it be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that by it is ſignified the whole tract of time, from his aſcention till his coming to Judgement, it will not follow from that text that Chriſt doth not raign till that time be expired; for he may, as he doth, raign and exerciſe many acts of his regal power before he paſs the final ſentence upon all men and Angels. His other reaſons are frivolous, and not <hi>ad idem.</hi> Yet his laſt argument ſave one is, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt hath left to civil Governors their power, therefore he hath left none to the Church. And its true that he hath left no civil power of the ſword to the Church; yet it doth not hence follow, that he hath denyed it the ſpiritual power of the keyes. And here he makes a moſt abominable digreſſion, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we may deny or profeſs againſt our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and comply with civil powers commanding and forbidding, contrary to that which Chriſt hath commanded and forbidden, and ſo hath taken away the ground of all Martyrdom, and razed the very foundation of our Chriſtian confeſſion. Beſides he ſeems to put a difference between their power to Preach, and their power to Teach, but he will not let us know what this difference is. And his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments tend to prove, that Miniſters have no power to command, no authority: yet the people are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to obey them that rule over them, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves, becauſe they watch over their ſouls, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. And he that heareth them, heareth Chriſt and God that ſent him; and he that deſpiſeth them deſpiſeth Chriſt, and God that ſent him. To that purpoſe, we read in <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.17. And how can
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170310:108"/>this poſſibly be true, if this have no authority? no law, no ſin. To teach and preach in ſuch a manner, as they who will not hear and obey, ſhall be guilty as contemners of the divine Majeſty, and ſo, as that it ſhall be more tolerable for <hi>Sodom</hi> in the day of judgement then for them, is to teach with authority and power, and the ſame no doubt greater then any Prince civil in the world is inveſted withal. For they cannot command, ſo as to make the diſobedient li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to eternal penalties.</p>
            <p>He granteth further, that they have power to Baptize, and by Baptiſm admit into Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which is a ſpiritual naturalization: and alſo to abſolve and excommunicate: yet the former is an act of Legiſlation, the latter of Juriſdiction: and how can that be performed without power? Thus the man is pleaſed to confute himſelf. Yet in the acts of Juriſdiction, we do not affirm the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church to be infallible, becauſe they can have no infallible knowledge of the inward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the ſouls of perſons penitent or impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Yet ſometimes the evidence of the cauſe is ſuch, that an abſolute ſentence on earth is made valid from heaven. And this Juriſdiction exerciſed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Laws of Chriſt, hath alwaies a real effect upon the party judged, and that without any co-er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive power civil at all. And the effect was comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or terrible, both unto Believers and Apoſtates too, according as they ſhould be truly impenitent or penitent. This power is alwaies in the Church, and to be exerciſed by ſuch as are truſted with that power, and fit for ſuch a work. And this is the plain truth, though the world be on a flame, and ſo many
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170310:108"/>Chriſtians in a cumbuſtion, becauſe of their different opinions concerning the ſubject of this power. But concerning this point I have ſpoken more at large in another Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>He goes on to teach us the cauſes of Excomuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and denies hereſie to be any cauſe, though ſcandal by his own confeſſion be; yet hereſie is the greateſt ſcandal. And here he abuſeth that place of <hi>Titus,</hi> 3.10. where its written, <hi>A man that is an Heretick after the firſt and ſecond admonition reject;</hi> where he plainly contradicts the Apoſtles words. As though he had ſaid, Reject the hereſie, not the perſon; whereas the Apoſtle commands the rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the perſon, the Heretick, and not only the hereſie. That ſome make Articles of Faith, which God never made, ſuch cannot be excuſed. After this he determines the perſons who are liable to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, yet ſo as that he might have been inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted better, then he hath inſtructed us, by thoſe who deſerve to be his Maſters. He exempts one Church from the juriſdiction of another, ſo that the one cannot excommunicate the other. Yet he doth not inform us what the extent of a Church-Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is, and ſo leaves the queſtion undecided. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo exempts all Soveraign Princes and Aſſemblies from excommunication, yet ſo as that he moſt groſly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes the nature and effect of excommunication. Yet here he ſtaies not: but a ſubject obeying his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns command is not liable to this ſentence, neither can it be in this cauſe and caſe of any effect, if we may believe him. This in <hi>[terminis]</hi> is falſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he mean obedience <hi>in licitis.</hi> The reſt of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning this particular is frivolous. The
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170310:109"/>of the Chapter is taken up and ſpent in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of two points. The 1. is making of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture Canon and Law: The 2. the power of the Pope. The power of making Scripture-Canon is given by him unto the Soveraign civil, being Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. Yet whether he be Chriſtian or no, he hath power to bind his ſubjects to acknowledge it <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poena temporali;</hi> But the Scripture is Canonical in it ſelf, without any ſuch Law at all. As for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie concerning the Popes power he undertakes <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who had often been anſwered in a far better manner, and more effectually by many before him. And the truth is, both he and the Cardinal run in extreams, the one on one ſide, and the other on the other ſide of the way of truth. For that power which the one arrogates to the Pope, the other gives to Chriſtian civil powers, but both unjuſtly. For Eccleſiaſtical power is due in ſome meaſure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Pope, but not unto the civil Soveraign. The Pope is a Presbyter, and a Biſhop, and ſome power was due unto him by divine Law. But by that which humane Conſtitutions gave him, and by his own uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation he had ingroſſed, he was advanced very high. To be a Patriarch would not ſerve his turn, but he muſt be Chriſts univerſal Vicar, and in the end by that means at length he hooked in the temporal power of the ſword.</p>
            <p>But to leave them both in their errours, wherein they have entangled themſelves, before I conclude this Chapter, I will ſay ſomething of Church-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and the Church-revenue. The Church-officers may be con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dered either according to their Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution or Imployment. According to the firſt they
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170310:109"/>were extraordinary or ordinary. Extraordinary were ſuch as had their power and gifts more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from Chriſt, as Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts. And here by the way, we may take notice of two er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and miſtakes of the Author.
<list>
                  <item>1. In that he affirms <hi>Matthias</hi> to be made an Apoſtle by the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of an hundred and twenty Brethren aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together. Whereas from the text its apparent, that they did only ſingle out by ſuffrage two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whom they conceived ſo qualified, that one of them might, if God pleaſed, be made an Apoſtle for to ſucceed <hi>Judas;</hi> and refer the caſe to God by prayer and lot, that he might determine, whether of the two ſhould be an Apoſtle, to make up the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of twelve. Upon the reference, God did chuſe <hi>Matthias,</hi> and ſo, that he made him an Apoſtle, and refuſed the other. To make an extraordinary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer was above the power of the Apoſtles and the Church, therefore they did not take it upon them.</item>
                  <item>2. The ſecond errour is, That <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were made Apoſtles by the Church of <hi>Antioch, Acts</hi> 13.2, 3. yet <hi>Barnabas</hi> in ſtrict ſenſe was no Apoſtle; and <hi>Paul</hi> was an Apoſtle before he came to <hi>Antioch.</hi> He was a ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, called to be an Apoſtle, ſeparated to the Goſpel of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.1. His calling to be an Apoſtle was not of men, nor by man, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1. His ſeparation was twofold,

                        <item>1. From God, who ſeparated him from his Mothers womb, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15.</item>
                        <item>2. From man, as by the prayers and faſting of the Church of <hi>Antioch:</hi> Yet Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> is not afraid to contradict the Scriptures.</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Ordinary officers of the Church, who ſucceeded the extraordinary, were Paſtors and Teachers, <hi>Eph.</hi>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:170310:110"/>4.11. Both the ordinary and extraordinary in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their employment, were either ſuch as were deſigned for feeding of the ſoul, by Prayer, Word, Sacraments, and were to perform the acts of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, worſhip, diſcipline: or for feeding of the body, and outward relief: and ſuch were Deacons. After that the number of Chriſtians were increaſed, and devided into Congregations, the Paſtors and Teachers were ſet over their ſeveral Congregations and Flocks aſſigned unto them, and theſe were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Elders.</p>
            <p>Now the Queſtion is, who in a Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth have power to make, conſtitute, ordain theſe ordinary Officers? The Common-wealth ſaith he; the Church, ſay others. He confeſſeth that the Church did exerciſe this power till civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns became Chriſtian: and then both the power and exerciſe thereof ceaſed to be in the Church, if we may believe him; but his credit is not much, and with me his Authority is none. To determine this queſtion, we muſt obſerve that its one thing to be a Paſtor, Miniſter, or Presbyter: another thing to be the Paſtor of a certain congregation, and another to have a right to ſome temporal revenue or dignity annexed. A Miniſter was conſtituted in all well-ordered Churches, to this day by the Church. The Church and ſuch as the Church doth truſt, doth chuſe him, try him, approve him, and ordains him. And by the nomination, approbation, ordination of the Church, according to the will of Chriſt all Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters are made publick officers of the Church, and ſeparated to their function of publick preaching, praying, adminiſtration of the Sacraments. Neither
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170310:110"/>is there any place in all the New Teſtament, where it can be proved that either Chriſt or his Apoſtles, who had this power, did ever derive it to the State or Civil Soveraign, whether Chriſtian or no Chriſtian. That every civil Soveraign hath power to preach, baptize, ordain, and perform all Miniſterial acts, and that as a publick Officer, is an impudent aſſertion, and contrary to the Book of God; &amp; is evident from that reaſon given by him, why they uſe not to do theſe things: which is, becauſe the buſineſs of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth takes up their whole time. Yet he that will be a Miniſter, muſt watch over his flock, be as ſouldiers, who going to war, muſt not entangle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the affairs of this life, 2 <hi>Timothy</hi> 2.4. As he muſt have ſufficient knowledge in thoſe things which belong unto his calling, and integrity of life, ſo he muſt engage himſelf to Chriſt and his Church, to lay aſide all other employments to feed Chriſts flock, and this muſt take up his whole time. To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle himſelf with other buſineſs, and ſo neglect his charge, is to be unfaithful, and in effect renounce his calling. From this falſe principle it is, that ſo many, who have a little more knowledge in Scripture then ordinary Chriſtians of the loweſt form, a bold face, and voluble tongue, take upon them to preach, and preſume to perform other Miniſterial duties, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be ſouldiers, or civil Magiſtrates, or Tradeſmen, or all together: Theſe will be Elders and Miniſters, although they entangle themſelves with the affairs of this life, as though the Holy-Ghoſt had made them Over-ſeers to feed his Church, purchaſed by his blood But wo unto them when they ſhall appear before the tribunal of Chriſt to give their
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170310:111"/>laſt account. But conſider, a Miniſter as he hath a temporal right unto ſome temporal revenue, dignity, juriſdiction, the Church hath nothing to do with him. The Church looks after his ſpiritual qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and capacity. After that Emperours and civil powers endowed the Church with a certain revenue, and annexed unto Biſhopricks, civil juriſdictions, and temporal dignities, there was ſome reaſon why the preſentation and inveſtiture ſhould belong unto them, but there was no ſuch thing from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>The maintenance of the Miniſters of the Goſpel is determined by this Author to be benevolence: yet at length convinced by the arguments of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. He confeſſeth that it was ſuch a benevolence as was due, and that the Flock was bound to maintain their Paſtor. By which confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he hath anſwered his own allegation, <hi>Freely give, becauſe you have freely received, Mat</hi> 10.8. which place is abuſed by him, as it is by the enemies of the Church at this day. For as by him, ſo by them, its underſtood and applyed, as though our Saviours meaning had been, That becauſe they gave nothing for their gifts and authority, ſo they muſt neither demand, nor receive any thing for the uſe of them. And by this means they make our Saviour to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict himſelf, for afterwards he ſaith, That the workman (and ſuch is every Miniſter) is worthy of his meat, ver. 10. of his hire, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.7. From whence <hi>Paul</hi> informs us, That Chriſt ordained, that they which preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.14. And therefore according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Ordinance of Chriſt he commands, <hi>That he
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170310:111"/>who is taught in the Word, communicate to him who teacheth in all good things, Gal.</hi> 6.6. From all which its very evident, that maintenance is due to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and that by a Law, and the ſame divine, and far more obliging then any civilact in the world. And if Chriſtian people had a propriety in their goods, (as of this there can be no doubt) this might eaſily make this maintenance competent, comfortable, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and that without any Law of the civil power, and they were bound ſo to do. When Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces endowed the Church with titles, they did but their duty, and they conceived, that no better way of proviſion could be deviſed by the wit of man. Neither can any Antidecimarian to this day inform us of a better. Yet if we be once Miniſters, we are bound to preach the Goſpel, though we beg our bread. But woe unto them who ſhall deny it, or take it out of our mouths.</p>
